# Kheti Sahayak MVP Project Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the "Kheti Sahayak" mobile application, based on the provided Product Requirement Document (PRD) and High-Level Design (HLD).

## 1. Project Focus & Scope

For the initial build, the focus will be solely on the **mobile application (Android/iOS)**. The web portal is considered a future enhancement to streamline initial development and delivery.

## 2. Chosen Technology Stack

*   **Mobile Frontend:** **Flutter** for cross-platform development, enabling a single codebase for both Android and iOS.
*   **Backend (APIs):** **Node.js with Express.js** for building scalable and high-performance RESTful APIs.
*   **Databases:**
    *   **Relational:** **PostgreSQL** for structured data (user profiles, marketplace listings, logbook entries).
    *   **NoSQL:** **MongoDB** for unstructured data (e.g., forum posts, educational content).
    *   **Caching:** **Redis** for fast access to frequently requested data (e.g., weather data, recommendations).
*   **Object Storage:** **AWS S3** for storing user-uploaded media (images for diagnostics, videos for educational content).
*   **Cloud Provider:** **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** will be used for hosting all backend services, databases, and storage due to its comprehensive suite of services and scalability.

## 3. Prioritized MVP Features

To ensure a focused and timely delivery, the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will include the following core features:

1.  **User Authentication & Profile Management:** Secure login, registration, and basic profile editing.
2.  **Localized Weather Forecast:** Hyperlocal weather data and critical alerts.
3.  **Crop Health Diagnostics:** AI-based disease/pest identification via image upload.
4.  **Marketplace (Basic Buy/Sell):** Core functionality for farmers to list and buy/sell agricultural products.
5.  **Educational Content:** Access to articles and videos on farming best practices.

## 4. Detailed Project Plan Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Services

*   **Project Setup & Repository Initialization:**
    *   Create monorepo structure (or separate repos for frontend/backend).
    *   Initialize Flutter project for mobile app.
    *   Initialize Node.js/Express.js project for backend.
    *   Set up basic CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline) for automated builds and deployments.
*   **Backend Infrastructure Setup (AWS):**
    *   **VPC & Networking:** Configure secure network environment.
    *   **Compute:** Set up EC2 instances or AWS Fargate for Node.js application deployment.
    *   **Databases:**
        *   Deploy **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)** for relational data.
        *   Deploy **AWS DocumentDB (MongoDB compatible)** for NoSQL data.
        *   Deploy **AWS ElastiCache (Redis)** for caching.
    *   **Storage:** Configure **AWS S3** buckets for media storage.
    *   **API Gateway:** Set up AWS API Gateway to expose backend APIs securely.
    *   **Monitoring & Logging:** Integrate AWS CloudWatch for application and infrastructure monitoring.
*   **User Authentication & Profile Management:**
    *   **Backend:** Implement user registration, login (JWT-based authentication), and profile management APIs.
    *   **Mobile:** Develop UI for user onboarding, login, and profile editing. Integrate with backend authentication APIs.

### Phase 2: Core Feature Development

*   **Localized Weather Forecast:**
    *   **Backend:** Integrate with a reliable weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, AccuWeather) to fetch hyperlocal weather data. Implement caching using Redis.
    *   **Mobile:** Display current weather, 7-day forecast, and implement push notifications for critical alerts.
*   **Crop Health Diagnostics:**
    *   **Backend:**
        *   Integrate with an AI/ML service (e.g., AWS Rekognition, custom ML model deployed on AWS SageMaker) for image-based disease/pest identification.
        *   Develop APIs for image upload (to S3) and diagnosis results.
    *   **Mobile:** Implement image capture/upload functionality. Display diagnosis results and basic recommendations.
*   **Marketplace (Basic Buy/Sell):**
    *   **Backend:** Develop APIs for listing products (crops, agri-inputs), searching, and basic transaction initiation. Store data in PostgreSQL.
    *   **Mobile:** Create UI for browsing listings, viewing product details, and creating new listings.
*   **Educational Content:**
    *   **Backend:** Develop APIs to serve educational articles and videos. Store content metadata in MongoDB.
    *   **Mobile:** Implement a section for browsing and viewing educational content.

### Phase 3: Cross-Cutting Concerns & Deployment

*   **Multilingual Support:**
    *   Implement internationalization (i18n) in Flutter for UI text.
    *   Consider a translation service (e.g., AWS Translate) for dynamic content if needed, or pre-translate static content.
*   **Offline Functionality (Basic):**
    *   Implement local data caching for essential information (e.g., weather, educational content) using SQLite or similar local storage in Flutter.
    *   Define synchronization strategy for when connectivity resumes.
*   **Security Enhancements:**
    *   Implement input validation on both frontend and backend.
    *   Ensure data encryption in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (database encryption).
    *   Conduct basic security audits.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Implement unit tests for both frontend and backend.
    *   Conduct integration tests for API endpoints.
    *   Perform manual testing for all implemented features.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Deploy the backend services to AWS.
    *   Prepare and publish the Flutter mobile application to Google Play Store (Android) and Apple App Store (iOS).
