## üì¶ Building for Production

### App Signing Setup

Keystore is already configured:
- **Location:** `~/upload-keystore.jks`
- **Password:** `KhetiSahayak@2024`
- **Alias:** `upload`

**Verify configuration:**

```bash
# Check key.properties exists
cat android/key.properties

# Should show:
# storePassword=KhetiSahayak@2024
# keyPassword=KhetiSahayak@2024
# keyAlias=upload
# storeFile=/Users/prakash.ponali/upload-keystore.jks
```

### Build Release Bundle

```bash
# Clean previous builds
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Build App Bundle (for Google Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release

# Output:
# build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

### Build Release APK

```bash
# Build single APK
flutter build apk --release

# Build split APKs (smaller size)
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release

# Outputs:
# build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
# build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk
# build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk
# build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-x86_64-release.apk
```

## üß™ Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
flutter test

# Integration tests
flutter test integration_test/

# Test with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Pre-Build Testing
- [ ] Change API_BASE_URL to device IP or production URL
- [ ] Test on Android emulator
- [ ] Test on physical device (different Android versions)
- [ ] Test with airplane mode (offline functionality)
- [ ] Test camera permissions
- [ ] Test storage permissions
- [ ] Test image upload (camera)
- [ ] Test image upload (gallery)

#### Post-Build Testing
- [ ] Install release APK on device
- [ ] Verify app name shows as "Kheti Sahayak"
- [ ] Verify app icon displays correctly
- [ ] Test all features in release mode
- [ ] Check for crashes or ANRs
- [ ] Verify ProGuard didn't break anything

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Unable to connect to server"

**Problem:** App can't reach backend API

```bash
# Solution 1: Check API_BASE_URL in lib/.env
# For emulator: http://10.0.2.2:3000/api
# For device: http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:3000/api

# Solution 2: Check backend is running
cd kheti_sahayak_backend
npm run dev

# Solution 3: Check firewall allows connections
# Windows: Windows Defender Firewall ‚Üí Allow an app
# Mac: System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Firewall ‚Üí Options
```

#### 2. "Keystore file not found"

**Problem:** Build fails with keystore error

```bash
# Solution: Verify keystore path in android/key.properties
# Update with absolute path:
storeFile=/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/upload-keystore.jks

# Or regenerate keystore:
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

#### 3. "Gradle build failed"

```bash
# Solution 1: Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release

# Solution 2: Clear Gradle cache
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter build apk --release

# Solution 3: Update Gradle (if needed)
cd android
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=8.0
```

#### 4. "Duplicate class found"

**Problem:** Dependency conflicts

```bash
# Solution: Check pubspec.yaml for duplicates
# Fixed in latest version (connectivity_plus, path_provider were duplicated)

flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

#### 5. "Permission denied"

**Problem:** Camera/Storage permissions not granted

```bash
# Solution 1: Check AndroidManifest.xml permissions are declared
# (Already configured in this project)

# Solution 2: Request permissions at runtime
# (Already implemented in the app)

# Solution 3: Manually grant in device settings
# Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Kheti Sahayak ‚Üí Permissions
```

## üìä Performance Optimization

### App Size Optimization

```bash
# Build with obfuscation and minification (already configured)
flutter build appbundle --release

# Analyze app size
flutter build apk --analyze-size --target-platform android-arm64

# Split APKs by ABI (reduces size per device)
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```

### ProGuard Configuration

ProGuard rules are already configured in `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`

Key rules:
- Keep Dio classes
- Keep JSON serialization
- Keep Flutter classes
- Keep SQLite classes

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented

- [x] API keys not in version control
- [x] JWT tokens in secure storage
- [x] HTTPS for API communication
- [x] Password hashing on backend
- [x] ProGuard obfuscation for release
- [x] Keystore not in git

### üîí Additional Recommendations

1. **Certificate Pinning** (Future enhancement)
   ```dart
   // Add to dio configuration
   dio.httpClientAdapter = IOHttpClientAdapter()
     ..onHttpClientCreate = (client) {
       client.badCertificateCallback = (cert, host, port) => false;
       return client;
     };
   ```

2. **Root Detection** (Future enhancement)
   - Add `flutter_jailbreak_detection` package
   - Prevent app from running on rooted devices

3. **Code Obfuscation** (Already enabled)
   ```bash
   # Build with obfuscation
   flutter build apk --obfuscate --split-debug-info=./debug-info
   ```
