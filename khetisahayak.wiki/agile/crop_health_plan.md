# Crop Health Diagnostics - Agile Planning

## Epic: AI-Powered Crop Health Diagnostics
**Objective**: Enable farmers to identify and manage crop health issues through an intuitive, AI-powered diagnostic tool.

### Feature 1: Image Capture & Upload
**User Story**: As a farmer, I want to capture or upload images of my crops so that I can get them analyzed for potential issues.

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Design and implement camera capture interface
- [ ] Implement image gallery integration
- [ ] Add image quality validation (min 800x600px, <10MB)
- [ ] Create image preview and editing capabilities
- [ ] Implement multiple image upload (max 5)
- [ ] Add image compression for better performance
- [ ] Write unit tests for image processing
- [ ] Implement error handling for failed uploads

### Feature 2: AI-Powered Analysis
**User Story**: As a farmer, I want accurate analysis of my crop images so that I can identify potential health issues.

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Integrate computer vision model API
- [ ] Implement model response handling
- [ ] Add confidence score calculation
- [ ] Create fallback mechanism for low-confidence results
- [ ] Implement model versioning
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for model accuracy
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for model performance

### Feature 3: Diagnostic Results & Recommendations
**User Story**: As a farmer, I want clear, actionable insights from my crop analysis so I can take appropriate action.

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Design results display UI
- [ ] Implement issue categorization (disease/pest/deficiency)
- [ ] Create detailed information cards for each issue
- [ ] Add treatment recommendations
- [ ] Implement preventive measures section
- [ ] Add nearest store locations for treatments
- [ ] Create shareable report format

### Feature 4: History & Tracking
**User Story**: As a farmer, I want to track my diagnostic history so I can monitor recurring issues.

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Design history view
- [ ] Implement local storage for offline access
- [ ] Add cloud sync functionality
- [ ] Create filtering and search capabilities
- [ ] Implement export to PDF
- [ ] Add notes functionality
- [ ] Create trend analysis visualization

### Feature 5: Offline Functionality
**User Story**: As a farmer with limited connectivity, I want to use the diagnostics feature offline.

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement offline data storage
- [ ] Create sync manager for pending operations
- [ ] Bundle lightweight model for offline use
- [ ] Add offline usage indicators
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution for sync
- [ ] Add storage management
