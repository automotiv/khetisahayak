# Active Context: Kheti Sahayak PRD Structuring

## What you're working on now

*   Currently structuring the Product Requirement Document (PRD) for the "Kheti Sahayak" application.
*   The primary source document is `Kheti Sahayak (1) 1.md`.
*   The goal is to break down the monolithic document into a set of organized Markdown files within the `prd/` directory, covering introduction, user profiles, features (core and supporting), non-functional requirements, and technical/design aspects.
*   As part of the initial setup and core workflow, creating the necessary Memory Bank files (`cline_docs/`) based on the structured PRD information.

## Recent changes

*   Created the `prd/` directory structure.
*   Created individual Markdown files for:
    *   Introduction (`prd/00_introduction.md`)
    *   User Profiles (`prd/01_user_profiles.md`)
    *   Features Overview (`prd/02_features_overview.md`)
    *   Detailed Feature Requirements (`prd/features/...` for Weather, Diagnostics, Recommendations, Marketplace, Sharing, Education, Expert Connect, Forum, Logbook, Schemes, Multilingual, Offline, Farm Profile, Auth, Notifications)
    *   Non-Functional Requirements (`prd/03_non_functional_requirements.md`)
    *   Technical Requirements (`prd/technical/...` for GPS, AI/ML)
    *   Design Requirements (`prd/design/ui_ux.md`)
*   Added `[TODO: ...]` placeholders in the PRD files to mark areas needing further detail or decisions.
*   Created the first Memory Bank file: `cline_docs/productContext.md`.

## Next steps

1.  Create the remaining Memory Bank files:
    *   `cline_docs/systemPatterns.md`
    *   `cline_docs/techContext.md`
    *   `cline_docs/progress.md`
2.  Once all Memory Bank files are created, the initial task of structuring the PRD from the source document will be complete.
3.  Use `attempt_completion` to report the successful creation of the structured PRD files and the Memory Bank.
