# Design Requirement: UI/UX Design Principles

## 1. Introduction

The User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design are critical for the success of "Kheti Sahayak," especially given the target audience of farmers who may have varying levels of digital literacy. The design must prioritize simplicity, intuitiveness, accessibility, and trustworthiness.

## 2. Goals

*   Create a user-friendly and intuitive interface that is easy to navigate and learn.
*   Ensure the application is accessible to users with diverse abilities and technical skills.
*   Build trust through a clean, professional, and consistent design.
*   Optimize the experience for mobile devices, considering potential use in field conditions (e.g., varying light, connectivity).
*   Reflect cultural context appropriately for Indian users.

## 3. Design Principles

*   **Simplicity:** Avoid clutter. Use clear layouts, straightforward navigation, and concise language. Prioritize core tasks.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain uniformity in design elements (buttons, icons, typography, color schemes), terminology, and interaction patterns across the entire application. Follow platform conventions (iOS/Android) where appropriate.
*   **Intuitiveness:** Design workflows that align with users' mental models and expectations. Make actions predictable.
*   **Feedback:** Provide clear visual or haptic feedback for user actions (taps, submissions, errors, loading states).
*   **Accessibility:** Design for inclusivity, considering users with visual, motor, or cognitive impairments.
*   **Farmer-Centric:** Design decisions should prioritize the needs, context, and potential limitations of the primary farmer user base.

## 4. UI/UX Requirements

### 4.1 Navigation
*   **UR4.1.1 Clear Hierarchy:** Implement a logical information architecture and clear navigation structure (e.g., bottom navigation bar for primary sections, side menu for secondary items).
*   **UR4.1.2 Easy Access:** Ensure core features are easily accessible from the main dashboard or navigation.
*   **UR4.1.3 Back Navigation:** Consistent and predictable back navigation behavior.
*   **UR4.1.4 Search:** Provide global search functionality where appropriate to find content or features quickly.

### 4.2 Visual Design
*   **UR4.2.1 Clean Layout:** Use ample white space and clear visual separation between elements.
*   **UR4.2.2 Typography:** Choose highly readable fonts suitable for multiple languages and scripts. Ensure adequate font sizes and line spacing. Allow users to adjust font size if possible.
*   **UR4.2.3 Color Palette:** Use a consistent and accessible color scheme with sufficient contrast ratios (meeting WCAG AA standards). Consider cultural connotations of colors.
*   **UR4.2.4 Iconography:** Use clear, universally understood icons with text labels where necessary for clarity.
*   **UR4.2.5 Imagery:** Use relevant and culturally appropriate images and illustrations.

### 4.3 Interaction Design
*   **UR4.3.1 Clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs):** Buttons and links should clearly indicate their purpose and be easily tappable on mobile devices.
*   **UR4.3.2 Form Design:** Design forms for easy data entry on mobile, using appropriate input types (dropdowns, date pickers, number pads). Provide clear labels and validation feedback.
*   **UR4.3.3 Loading States:** Use progress indicators (spinners, progress bars) for actions that take time to complete.
*   **UR4.3.4 Error Handling:** Display user-friendly error messages that explain the problem and suggest solutions. Avoid technical jargon.

### 4.4 Onboarding & Help
*   **UR4.4.1 First-Time User Experience (FTUE):** Provide a simple onboarding flow introducing key features and guiding initial setup (e.g., profile creation, language selection).
*   **UR4.4.2 Contextual Help:** Offer tooltips, info icons, or short tutorials within specific features where users might need guidance.
*   **UR4.4.3 Help Center/FAQs:** Provide an easily accessible section with answers to common questions and guides.

### 4.5 Accessibility (A11y)
*   **UR4.5.1 Screen Reader Support:** Ensure compatibility with screen readers (e.g., TalkBack on Android, VoiceOver on iOS) by using proper semantic elements and labels.
*   **UR4.5.2 Keyboard Navigation (Web):** If a web portal is developed, ensure it's navigable using a keyboard.
*   **UR4.5.3 Color Contrast:** Meet minimum contrast ratios for text and interactive elements.
*   **UR4.5.4 Target Size:** Ensure buttons and interactive elements have adequate tap target sizes for mobile use.
*   **UR4.5.5 Font Size Adjustment:** Support system font size settings or provide in-app options.

### 4.6 Language & Localization
*   **UR4.6.1 Layout Adaptation:** UI must adapt to varying text lengths and Right-to-Left (RTL) layouts for different languages. (See `prd/features/multilingual.md`)

### 4.7 Performance Considerations
*   **UR4.7.1 Smoothness:** Ensure smooth scrolling and animations.
*   **UR4.7.2 Responsiveness:** UI should respond quickly to user input.

## 5. Design Process & Deliverables

*   **DP5.1 User Research:** Conduct research (interviews, surveys) with target farmers to understand their needs, context, and digital literacy levels.
*   **DP5.2 Personas & User Journeys:** Create personas representing key user types and map out their journeys through the application.
*   **DP5.3 Wireframing & Prototyping:** Develop low-fidelity wireframes and interactive prototypes for key workflows to test usability early.
*   **DP5.4 UI Mockups & Style Guide:** Create high-fidelity mockups and a comprehensive style guide defining typography, colors, iconography, components, and spacing.
*   **DP5.5 Usability Testing:** Conduct usability testing sessions with representative users throughout the design process to gather feedback and iterate on designs.

## 6. Future Enhancements

*   **FE6.1 Voice User Interface (VUI):** Explore voice commands for hands-free operation.
*   **FE6.2 Enhanced Personalization:** Further tailor the UI based on user behavior and preferences.
*   **FE6.3 Dark Mode:** Offer an optional dark theme for improved viewing in low light conditions and potential battery savings on OLED screens.
