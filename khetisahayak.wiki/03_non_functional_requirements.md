# 3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

This section outlines the non-functional requirements for the "Kheti Sahayak" platform, specifying quality attributes and constraints that are not tied to specific features but apply to the system as a whole.

## 3.1 Performance & Scalability

*   **NFR3.1.1 Response Time:** Interactive user actions (e.g., loading screens, applying filters, submitting forms) should generally complete within 2-3 seconds under normal load conditions. Critical actions like payment processing should have clear progress indicators.
*   **NFR3.1.2 Load Handling:** The system must be designed to handle a target number of concurrent users [TODO: Define target concurrent users for v1.0 and future] without significant degradation in performance.
*   **NFR3.1.3 Scalability:** The architecture must support horizontal and/or vertical scaling to accommodate future growth in users, data volume, and feature complexity. Cloud-native architectures are preferred. (See also System Architecture details in original doc).
*   **NFR3.1.4 Data Volume:** The system must efficiently handle large volumes of data, including user profiles, logbook entries, images/videos, marketplace listings, and forum posts. Database queries and indexing must be optimized.
*   **NFR3.1.5 API Performance:** Third-party API integrations (Weather, Payment, Translation) should not become bottlenecks. Implement timeouts, retries, and caching strategies.

## 3.2 Reliability & Availability

*   **NFR3.2.1 Uptime:** Target a high level of availability for core services (e.g., 99.5% uptime, excluding scheduled maintenance). [TODO: Define specific uptime target and SLA.]
*   **NFR3.2.2 Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to partial failures. Failure in one module (e.g., community forum) should not bring down the entire application. Implement redundancy where critical.
*   **NFR3.2.3 Data Backup & Recovery:** Implement regular, automated backups of all critical data (databases, user files). Define a clear disaster recovery plan and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) / Recovery Point Objective (RPO). [TODO: Define RTO/RPO targets.]
*   **NFR3.2.4 Error Handling:** Provide clear, user-friendly error messages for unexpected issues. Implement robust server-side and client-side error logging and monitoring.

## 3.3 Security

*   **NFR3.3.1 Data Encryption:** All sensitive data (user credentials, personal information, financial data, private messages) must be encrypted both in transit (using TLS/HTTPS) and at rest.
*   **NFR3.3.2 Authentication & Authorization:** Implement secure user authentication (see `prd/features/authentication.md` [TODO: Create this file]). Use role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access data and features appropriate to their role.
*   **NFR3.3.3 Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation on both client and server sides to prevent common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.
*   **NFR3.3.4 API Security:** Secure all internal and external APIs (e.g., using OAuth 2.0, API keys with rate limiting).
*   **NFR3.3.5 Dependency Management:** Regularly scan and update third-party libraries and dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **NFR3.3.6 Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
*   **NFR3.3.7 Privacy Compliance:** Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act, GDPR if applicable).

## 3.4 Usability & Accessibility

*   **NFR3.4.1 Learnability:** The application should be intuitive and easy to learn, especially for users with limited digital literacy. Provide onboarding tutorials and contextual help.
*   **NFR3.4.2 Accessibility (A11y):** Strive to meet accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG AA) to ensure usability for people with disabilities. This includes considerations for screen readers, keyboard navigation, color contrast, and font sizes.
*   **NFR3.4.3 Consistency:** Maintain a consistent design language, navigation patterns, and terminology across the application.
*   **NFR3.4.4 Language:** Support multiple Indian languages effectively (See `prd/features/multilingual.md`).

## 3.5 Maintainability & Extensibility

*   **NFR3.5.1 Code Quality:** Adhere to established coding standards and best practices for the chosen technology stack. Code should be well-documented and modular.
*   **NFR3.5.2 Modularity:** Design the application with a modular architecture to facilitate easier updates, testing, and addition of new features.
*   **NFR3.5.3 Testability:** Ensure code is written in a way that supports automated testing (unit, integration tests). Target high test coverage for critical components. [TODO: Define target code coverage %.]
*   **NFR3.5.4 Configuration Management:** Externalize configuration settings (API keys, database connections, feature flags) from the codebase.

## 3.6 Deployment & Operations

*   **NFR3.6.1 Deployment Process:** Implement automated CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines for efficient and reliable deployments.
*   **NFR3.6.2 Monitoring & Logging:** Implement comprehensive monitoring (application performance, server health, error rates) and centralized logging. Use tools like Grafana, Prometheus, ELK stack, Sentry, etc.
*   **NFR3.6.3 Rollout Strategy:** Define a strategy for rolling out new versions (e.g., phased rollout, blue-green deployment) to minimize user impact.
*   **NFR3.6.4 Environment Parity:** Maintain similar environments for development, testing (staging), and production to reduce deployment issues.

## 3.7 Testing Strategy

*   **NFR3.7.1 Unit Testing:** Developers write unit tests for individual functions/modules.
*   **NFR3.7.2 Integration Testing:** Test the interaction between different modules and services.
*   **NFR3.7.3 End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Simulate user workflows across the application.
*   **NFR3.7.4 User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involve target users (farmers) to test the application in real-world scenarios before release.
*   **NFR3.7.5 Performance Testing:** Conduct load and stress tests to ensure the application meets performance NFRs.
*   **NFR3.7.6 Security Testing:** Perform vulnerability scans and penetration tests.
*   **NFR3.7.7 Usability Testing:** Observe users interacting with the app to identify usability issues.
*   **NFR3.7.8 Localization Testing:** Test functionality and UI layout for all supported languages.
*   **NFR3.7.9 Offline Functionality Testing:** Test caching, offline actions, and data synchronization thoroughly.

[TODO: Quantify specific NFR targets where possible (e.g., response times, uptime %, concurrent users).]
[TODO: Define specific tools for monitoring, logging, CI/CD.]
