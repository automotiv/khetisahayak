# **2.2.15 Operational Aspects**
*(Incorporates content from original 2.3.6)*

*(Note: This section covers day-to-day operational considerations for maintaining the platform, especially regarding external integrations like Weather APIs. Related NFRs are in `prd/03_non_functional_requirements.md`)*

### **2.2.15.1 Introduction**
Operational aspects refer to the ongoing activities required to ensure the smooth, reliable, and efficient running of the "Kheti Sahayak" platform and its integrations after deployment.

### **2.2.15.2 Monitoring and Uptime**
*   **TR2.2.15.2.1 Continuous Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive monitoring tools (application performance monitoring - APM, infrastructure monitoring, log analysis) to track system health, performance metrics, error rates, and resource utilization in real-time.
*   **TR2.2.15.2.2 External Service Monitoring:** Specifically monitor the health, latency, and error rates of critical third-party integrations (Weather API, Payment Gateway, SMS Gateway, etc.).
*   **TR2.2.15.2.3 Uptime Commitment:** Strive to meet the defined uptime NFRs (e.g., 99.5%). Track actual uptime and reasons for any downtime.
*   **TR2.2.15.2.4 Alert Mechanisms:** Configure automated alerts for critical system events, performance degradation, high error rates, security issues, or failures in external integrations, notifying the operations/dev team promptly.

### **2.2.15.3 Data Accuracy & Validation (Operational)**
*   **Process:** Establish operational procedures for monitoring the accuracy of data fetched from external sources (e.g., Weather API, Government Schemes).
*   **Process:** Implement mechanisms to handle user reports of data inaccuracies (e.g., incorrect weather forecast, outdated scheme info) and investigate/rectify them.

### **2.2.15.4 Handling Outages (Internal & External)**
*   **TR2.2.15.4.1 Backup Systems/Fallback:** Have fallback mechanisms in place for critical external dependencies (e.g., secondary Weather API, cached data display). (See relevant feature files).
*   **Process:** Define incident response procedures for handling both internal system outages and failures of external dependencies.
*   **UX2.2.15.4.2 User Communication:** Have a plan for communicating significant outages or service disruptions to users proactively (e.g., via in-app banners, notifications if possible).

### **2.2.15.5 Cost Management**
*   **Process:** Regularly monitor cloud infrastructure costs and usage of paid third-party APIs (Weather, SMS, Maps, etc.).
*   **Process:** Implement cost optimization strategies (e.g., using caching effectively, choosing appropriate instance sizes, leveraging reserved instances/savings plans, optimizing API calls).

### **2.2.15.6 System Updates & Maintenance**
*   **Process:** Plan and schedule regular maintenance windows for system updates, patching, and deployments, minimizing disruption to users (e.g., during low-usage hours). Communicate scheduled maintenance in advance.
*   **TR2.2.15.6.1 CI/CD Pipeline:** Utilize CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment of updates. (See NFRs).
*   **TR2.2.15.6.2 Change Management:** Maintain logs and documentation for all system changes, updates, and deployments. Implement rollback procedures.
*   **Process:** Monitor external API documentation for changes and update integrations accordingly.

### **2.2.15.7 Scalability Management**
*   **Process:** Monitor resource utilization and performance metrics to anticipate scaling needs.
*   **TR2.2.15.7.1 Auto-Scaling:** Configure and tune auto-scaling rules for cloud resources to handle load variations automatically and cost-effectively.

### **2.2.15.8 Security Measures (Operational)**
*   **Process:** Regularly review access logs and security alerts.
*   **Process:** Perform periodic security audits and vulnerability scans.
*   **Process:** Keep systems patched and dependencies updated. (See NFRs).
*   **Process:** Manage API keys and secrets securely, implementing rotation policies.

### **2.2.15.9 Conclusion**
Proactive operational management, including monitoring, maintenance, cost control, and incident response, is essential for ensuring "Kheti Sahayak" remains a reliable and trustworthy platform for its users.
