# NFR: Connectivity Issues in "Kheti Sahayak"

## 1.45.1 Introduction

Connectivity remains a critical challenge for digital agriculture platforms, especially in rural and remote areas where internet access is inconsistent or slow. "Kheti Sahayak" must be designed to operate reliably under these constraints, ensuring uninterrupted access to essential features for all users.

## 1.45.2 Challenges

* **Intermittent Internet Access:** Many users may experience frequent disconnections, making real-time data access unreliable.
* **Slow Data Speeds:** Limited bandwidth can hinder the loading of content, images, or videos.
* **Data Caps and Costs:** High data costs or limited data plans may discourage users from accessing data-heavy features.
* **Device Limitations:** Older smartphones with limited processing power or storage may struggle with modern apps.

## 1.45.3 Intermittent Internet Access

* **Challenge:** Given the primary user base of farmers, many may reside in areas with inconsistent internet connectivity.
* **Solution:**
  * **Offline Mode:** Design the app to function offline with essential features. When online, the app should sync and update data.

## 1.45.4 Slow Data Speeds

* **Challenge:** Slow or unreliable data speeds can frustrate users and limit access to information.
* **Solution:**
  * **Data Compression:** Optimize data usage so the app consumes minimal data, ensuring faster loading even on slow connections.
  * **Lightweight Assets:** Use compressed images and minimalistic UI elements to reduce loading times.

## 1.45.5 Data Caps and Costs

* **Challenge:** High data costs or low data caps may restrict app usage.
* **Solution:**
  * **Selective Sync:** Allow users to choose which data to sync/download (e.g., only text, no images/videos).
  * **Data Usage Transparency:** Display data usage statistics and provide tips for minimizing consumption.

## 1.45.6 Device Limitations

* **Challenge:** Not all users have access to the latest smartphones.
* **Solution:**
  * **Optimized Performance:** Ensure the app is lightweight and runs smoothly on older devices.
  * **Lite Version:** Consider releasing a lite version for users with limited hardware capabilities.

## 1.45.7 Solutions

* **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Implement PWA features to enable offline access, background sync, and app-like experiences on any device.
* **Data Optimization:** Use caching, lazy loading, and efficient data structures to minimize bandwidth usage.
* **Intuitive UI/UX for Connectivity Issues:** Clearly indicate offline/online status, sync progress, and provide feedback for failed actions.

## 1.45.8 Best Practices

* **Regular Testing:** Test the app under various connectivity scenarios (offline, 2G/3G, etc.).
* **Graceful Degradation:** Ensure that core features remain usable even with limited connectivity.
* **User Education:** Provide guidance on how to use the app offline and manage data usage.

## 1.45.9 Conclusion

By proactively addressing connectivity challenges, "Kheti Sahayak" can deliver a reliable and inclusive experience for all farmers, regardless of their location or device capabilities. This approach not only increases user satisfaction but also broadens the platform's reach and impact.
