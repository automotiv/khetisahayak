# **2.2.3 System Architecture**

*(Note: This section describes the overall system structure. Related NFRs are in `prd/03_non_functional_requirements.md`)*

*   **TR2.2.3.1 Multi-Tier Architecture:** The "Kheti Sahayak" app will be built on a standard multi-tier architecture to separate concerns and enhance maintainability and scalability.

    *   **Front-end Layer:**
        *   **Mobile Application:** Developed using a cross-platform framework (e.g., React Native, Flutter) for iOS and Android to ensure code reusability and faster development cycles.
        *   **Web Portal (Optional):** Potential future web portal for specific user roles (e.g., Admins, Vendors) using responsive web design (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript framework).
    *   **Business Logic Layer (Backend):**
        *   **APIs:** Expose functionality via RESTful APIs. Technology choice like Node.js or Django mentioned as possibilities.
        *   **Middleware:** Implement middleware for handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, request validation, and data transformation.
    *   **Data Layer:**
        *   **Databases:** Utilize appropriate databases for different data types (e.g., Relational like PostgreSQL/MySQL for structured data; NoSQL like MongoDB for unstructured/document data).
        *   **File Storage:** Employ cloud-based object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for storing user-uploaded media (images, videos).
        *   **Caching:** Implement a caching layer (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to improve performance for frequently accessed data.

*   **TR2.2.3.2 Modularity:** The backend should be designed with modularity in mind, potentially evolving towards microservices for key independent functionalities (e.g., Marketplace, Recommendations, User Management) to improve scalability and fault isolation.
*   **TR2.2.3.3 API-Driven:** Communication between the frontend clients and the backend must occur exclusively through well-defined APIs.
