### ✨ New Features for Farmer Comfort and Accessibility

To further enhance the user experience for farmers, we are introducing several new features designed to make the Kheti Sahayak platform more comfortable, accessible, and valuable in their daily lives.

-   **[Voice Commands and Navigation](../plan/features/voice_commands):** Recognizing that many farmers may have limited digital literacy or may need to use the app while working in the fields, this feature will allow users to navigate the app and access key information using voice commands. This hands-free approach will make the app significantly easier to use for a wider range of farmers.

-   **[Financial Services Integration](../plan/features/financial_services):** Access to financial services is a major challenge for many farmers. By integrating with banks and financial institutions, we can provide farmers with direct access to loans, crop insurance, and savings accounts through the app. This will simplify the process of obtaining financial support and help farmers manage their finances more effectively.

-   **[Supply Chain Integration](../plan/features/supply_chain):** This feature will empower farmers by connecting them directly with buyers, eliminating the need for intermediaries and ensuring they receive a fair price for their produce. By providing a transparent and efficient supply chain, we can help farmers increase their income and build a more sustainable business.
