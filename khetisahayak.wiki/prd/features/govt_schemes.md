# Feature: Government Scheme Portal

## 1. Introduction

The Government Scheme Portal aims to be a centralized, easily accessible repository within "Kheti Sahayak" that informs farmers about relevant central and state government schemes, subsidies, grants, and other agricultural initiatives. This helps farmers stay updated and leverage available support programs.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide timely and accurate information about government schemes relevant to agriculture.
*   Simplify the discovery process for farmers compared to navigating multiple government websites.
*   Enable farmers to understand eligibility criteria and application processes.
*   Increase awareness and uptake of beneficial government programs among farmers.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Scheme Information Aggregation
*   **FR3.1.1 Data Sourcing:** The system must aggregate scheme information from reliable sources. Potential methods include:
    *   **API Integration:** Directly integrate with official government portals or databases via APIs, if available.
    *   **RSS Feeds:** Subscribe to RSS feeds from relevant government departments or news sources.
    *   **Web Scraping (Use with caution):** Periodically scrape designated government websites for updates (requires careful implementation and maintenance).
    *   **Manual Curation:** A content team manually curates and updates scheme information based on official announcements. [TODO: Define primary data sourcing strategy for v1.0.]
*   **FR3.1.2 Real-time Updates:** Ensure scheme information is updated promptly as new schemes are announced or existing ones are modified/closed.

### 3.2 Scheme Information Display
*   **FR3.2.1 Scheme Details:** For each scheme, display comprehensive information including:
    *   Scheme Name & Objective.
    *   Target Beneficiaries & Eligibility Criteria.
    *   Benefits Offered (subsidies, grants, training, etc.).
    *   Application Process & Required Documents.
    *   Application Deadlines (if applicable).
    *   Link to Official Scheme Website/Portal.
    *   Contact Information for queries.
*   **FR3.2.2 Categorization:** Organize schemes into relevant categories (e.g., Crop Insurance, Subsidies, Loans, Training, Water Management). [TODO: Define initial categories.]
*   **FR3.2.3 Language Support:** Provide scheme details in multiple regional languages. (See `prd/features/multilingual.md`)

### 3.3 Discovery & Filtering
*   **FR3.3.1 Search Functionality:** Allow users to search for schemes by name, keyword, or benefit type.
*   **FR3.3.2 Filtering:** Allow users to filter schemes based on:
    *   Eligibility (e.g., crop type, landholding size, region).
    *   Category/Benefit Type.
    *   State/Central Government.
    *   Application Status (Open/Closed).
*   **FR3.3.3 Personalized Filtering:** [Optional] Automatically filter or highlight schemes potentially relevant to the user based on their Farm Profile data (requires user consent).

### 3.4 User Interaction
*   **FR3.4.1 Bookmarking:** Allow users to save or bookmark schemes of interest for easy access.
*   **FR3.4.2 Sharing:** Enable users to share scheme details via external platforms (WhatsApp, etc.).
*   **FR3.4.3 Notifications:**
    *   Notify users about new schemes relevant to their profile or region.
    *   Send reminders about application deadlines for bookmarked schemes.
*   **FR3.4.4 Feedback/Reviews (Optional):** Allow users who have availed schemes to share their experience or tips (requires careful moderation). [TODO: Decide on user reviews for schemes in v1.0.]

### 3.5 Application Assistance (Informational)
*   **FR3.5.1 Guidance:** Provide simplified step-by-step guidance on the application process based on official information.
*   **FR3.5.2 Link Redirection:** Provide direct links to official online application portals where available. **Note:** The app will likely *not* handle direct application submission due to complexity and security, but will guide the user to the official channels.

## 4. User Experience (UX) Requirements

*   **UX4.1 Simple Navigation:** Easy browsing and filtering of schemes.
*   **UX4.2 Clear Presentation:** Display scheme details in an easy-to-understand format, potentially using summaries and bullet points.
*   **UX4.3 Trustworthiness:** Clearly indicate the source of information and the last updated date. Use official logos where appropriate and permitted.
*   **UX4.4 Accessibility:** Ensure information is accessible, considering users with varying levels of literacy.

## 5. Technical Requirements / Considerations

*   **TR5.1 Data Aggregation Engine:** Robust backend system to fetch, parse, store, and update scheme information from various sources.
*   **TR5.2 API/RSS Integration:** Reliable integration with chosen external data sources. Error handling for unavailable sources.
*   **TR5.3 Database:** Structure to store scheme details, categories, user bookmarks, etc.
*   **TR5.4 Update Frequency:** Define how often the system checks for updates from sources.

## 6. Security & Privacy Requirements

*   **SP6.1 Data Authenticity:** Ensure the information presented is accurate and sourced from official channels. Display disclaimers if information cannot be fully verified.
*   **SP6.2 Secure Links:** Ensure links to external government portals are correct and secure (HTTPS).
*   **SP6.3 User Data:** If personalizing scheme recommendations, handle user profile data securely and with consent.

## 7. Future Enhancements

*   **FE7.1 Application Status Tracking:** If government APIs allow, integrate features to help users track their application status.
*   **FE7.2 Document Assistance:** Provide guidance or templates for commonly required documents.
*   **FE7.3 Direct Feedback to Government:** Facilitate a channel for users to provide feedback on schemes directly to relevant government bodies (requires partnership).
*   **FE7.4 Integration with Logbook:** Link relevant expenses or activities in the logbook to specific schemes availed.

[TODO: Identify and prioritize specific government data sources/APIs/RSS feeds for integration.]
[TODO: Define the initial set of scheme categories.]
[TODO: Finalize the scope of personalized scheme filtering for v1.0.]
