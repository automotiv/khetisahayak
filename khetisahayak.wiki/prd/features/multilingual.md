# Feature: Multilingual Support

## 1. Introduction

Given the linguistic diversity of India, providing multilingual support is crucial for "Kheti Sahayak" to be accessible and usable by farmers across different regions. This feature ensures that the app interface, content, and potentially user interactions can be presented in multiple Indian languages.

## 2. Goals

*   Make the application accessible to farmers who are not proficient in English or Hindi.
*   Increase user adoption and engagement across diverse linguistic regions.
*   Build user trust and comfort by communicating in their native language.
*   Ensure consistency and accuracy across all supported languages.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Language Selection
*   **FR3.1.1 Initial Selection:** Prompt users to select their preferred language during the onboarding process or on first app launch.
*   **FR3.1.2 Manual Switching:** Allow users to easily switch the application language at any time via settings.
*   **FR3.1.3 Language Persistence:** The selected language preference must be saved and consistently applied across all app sessions for the user.

### 3.2 Scope of Translation
*   **FR3.2.1 UI Elements:** All static UI text elements (buttons, labels, menus, prompts, error messages) must be translatable.
*   **FR3.2.2 Static Content:** Educational content (articles, descriptions) provided by the platform must be available in supported languages. [TODO: Define process and scope for translating existing/new static content.]
*   **FR3.2.3 Dynamic Content (Considerations):**
    *   **User-Generated Content (Forum, Reviews):** Decide on the strategy for handling UGC. Options include:
        *   Displaying content in its original language only.
        *   Offering optional machine translation (e.g., via Google Translate API) with a disclaimer about potential inaccuracies.
        *   Encouraging users to post in multiple languages. [TODO: Define strategy for UGC translation.]
    *   **Expert Chat:** Decide if real-time translation support is needed/feasible for chat interactions. (See `prd/features/expert_connect.md`)
    *   **Government Schemes:** Translate scheme summaries/details where possible, while linking to original government sources. (See `prd/features/govt_schemes.md`)
*   **FR3.2.4 Notifications:** Push and in-app notifications must be sent in the user's preferred language.

### 3.3 Language & Translation Management
*   **FR3.3.1 Internationalization (i18n):** The application codebase must be architected to support internationalization, separating text strings from the code (e.g., using resource files).
*   **FR3.3.2 Localization (L10n):**
    *   Establish a process for translating strings into target languages. This may involve professional translators, community volunteers, or machine translation followed by human review.
    *   Ensure translations consider regional dialects and cultural nuances.
    *   Manage translations efficiently (e.g., using translation management platforms/tools).
*   **FR3.3.3 Adding New Languages:** The system should be extensible to easily add support for new languages in the future.
*   **FR3.3.4 Font Support:** Ensure appropriate fonts are used/embedded to correctly display characters for all supported languages, including complex scripts.
*   **FR3.3.5 Text Direction:** Support right-to-left (RTL) languages if necessary (e.g., Urdu).

## 4. User Experience (UX) Requirements

*   **UX4.1 Seamless Switching:** Language changes should apply instantly or after a quick app restart without losing user context.
*   **UX4.2 Consistent Terminology:** Use consistent translations for key terms across the application.
*   **UX4.3 Layout Adaptation:** UI layouts must adapt gracefully to different text lengths and directions in various languages to avoid broken interfaces.
*   **UX4.4 Culturally Appropriate:** Ensure icons, images, and examples used are culturally appropriate for the target linguistic regions.

## 5. Technical Requirements / Considerations

*   **TR5.1 i18n Framework:** Choose appropriate libraries/frameworks for the chosen development stack (iOS, Android, Web) to handle internationalization.
*   **TR5.2 Translation Management System:** Consider using tools like Lokalise, Transifex, or Phrase to manage translation workflows.
*   **TR5.3 Machine Translation APIs (Optional):** If used for dynamic content, integrate with reliable translation APIs (e.g., Google Cloud Translation, Microsoft Translator). Be mindful of costs and accuracy limitations.
*   **TR5.4 Performance:** Ensure loading language resources does not significantly impact app startup time or performance.
*   **TR5.5 Testing:** Implement a thorough testing process for each supported language, covering UI layout, text rendering, and translation accuracy/context.

## 6. Supported Languages (Initial Scope - v1.0)

*   **Primary:** English, Hindi.
*   **Regional:** [TODO: Define the initial set of regional languages based on target user demographics and feasibility. Examples: Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati.]

## 7. Future Enhancements

*   **FE7.1 More Languages:** Gradually add support for more regional languages and dialects based on user demand.
*   **FE7.2 Voice Input/Output:** Support voice commands and read-aloud features in multiple languages.
*   **FE7.3 Improved Dynamic Translation:** Leverage advancements in AI for better real-time translation of user-generated content.
*   **FE7.4 Community Translation Portal:** Allow community members to contribute and review translations.

[TODO: Finalize the list of supported languages for v1.0.]
[TODO: Define the detailed translation workflow and quality assurance process.]
[TODO: Decide on the strategy for translating dynamic/user-generated content.]
