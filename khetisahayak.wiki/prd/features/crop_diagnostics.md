# Feature: Crop Health Diagnostics

## 1. Introduction

Early and accurate identification of crop diseases and pest infestations is crucial for Indian farmers, who often lack timely access to agri-experts. Delays or misdiagnosis can lead to significant yield loss, financial hardship, and increased pesticide use. Many Indian farmers have limited access to extension services and may not recognize symptoms early. This feature leverages AI to democratize expert-level diagnostics, reduce crop loss, and promote sustainable management.

### 1.1 Indian Context & Challenges
- Over 30% of crop losses in India are due to pests and diseases.
- Most farmers rely on visual cues and neighbor advice, which can be unreliable.
- Image-based AI can bridge the gap, especially in remote/rural areas.

### 1.2 User Stories
- As a smallholder farmer, I want to upload a photo of my crop and get a simple, actionable diagnosis in my local language.
- As a user with low literacy, I want results presented with icons, audio, and minimal text.
- As a user with poor internet, I want my upload to resume automatically or work offline (with delayed diagnosis).
- As an agri-expert, I want to review difficult cases and provide feedback to improve the AI.

## 2. Goals

*   Enable farmers to easily upload images of potentially diseased or pest-affected crops.
*   Provide rapid, AI-based identification of common crop diseases and pests relevant to Indian agriculture.
*   Offer preliminary information on the identified issue, including potential causes and management strategies.
*   Facilitate connection with experts for confirmation or further advice when needed.
*   Support feedback loops for continuous AI improvement.

## 3. Functional Requirements

*   **FR3.1.2 Multiple Images:** Allow users to upload multiple images of the affected plant/area for better diagnostic accuracy.
*   **FR3.1.3 Supported Formats:** Support common image formats (JPG, JPEG, PNG). Provide clear error messages for unsupported formats.
*   **FR3.1.4 File Size Limit:** Implement a reasonable file size limit (e.g., 5-10MB per image) with clear feedback if the limit is exceeded.
*   **FR3.1.5 Image Quality Guidance:** Provide simple tips or checks for taking clear, well-lit photos suitable for diagnosis (e.g., focus on affected area, good lighting, avoid blur). Show sample images.
*   **FR3.1.6 Image Compression:** Implement client-side or server-side compression to optimize image size before processing/storage.
*   **FR3.1.7 Offline/Retry:** If upload fails due to connectivity, queue and retry automatically when online.

### 3.2 AI-Based Analysis
*   **FR3.2.1 Disease/Pest Identification:** The system must use a trained AI/ML model to analyze the uploaded image(s) and identify potential diseases or pests. (See also `prd/technical/ai_ml.md` [TODO: Create this file])
*   **FR3.2.2 Confidence Score:** The AI diagnosis should ideally provide a confidence score indicating the certainty of the identification.
*   **FR3.2.3 Multiple Possibilities:** If the AI is uncertain, it should present the top few likely possibilities, each with confidence scores.
*   **FR3.2.4 Information Display:** For identified issues, display:
    *   Name of the disease/pest (in local language and English).
    *   Common symptoms (text, icons, and reference images).
    *   Potential causes or contributing factors.
    *   Recommended management/treatment strategies (both organic and chemical, where applicable). [TODO: Define source and validation process for treatment info].
    *   Preventive measures.
*   **FR3.2.5 Handling Unidentified Issues:** If the AI cannot identify the issue or has low confidence, it should clearly state this and suggest alternative actions (e.g., consult an expert, check community forum).
*   **FR3.2.6 Example AI Output:**
```json
{
  "diagnosis": [
    {"name": "Powdery Mildew", "confidence": 0.87, "symptoms": "White powdery spots on leaves...", "treatment": "Use sulfur-based fungicide..."},
    {"name": "Downy Mildew", "confidence": 0.12, "symptoms": "Yellow patches...", "treatment": "Remove affected leaves..."}
  ],
  "unidentified": false
}
```

### 3.3 Integration with Other Features
*   **FR3.3.1 Expert Connect:** Provide a direct option to share the uploaded image(s) and AI diagnosis results with an expert for confirmation or further advice. (See `prd/features/expert_connect.md`)
*   **FR3.3.2 Community Forum:** Allow users to share the image(s) and diagnosis (or lack thereof) to the community forum to seek peer advice. (See `prd/features/community_forum.md`)
*   **FR3.3.3 Digital Logbook:** Allow users to save the diagnosis result (including images) to their digital logbook for record-keeping. (See `prd/features/digital_logbook.md`)
*   **FR3.3.4 Educational Content:** Link the identified disease/pest to relevant articles or videos in the educational content section. (See `prd/features/educational_content.md`)

### 3.4 User History
