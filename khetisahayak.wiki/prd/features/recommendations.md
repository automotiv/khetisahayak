# Feature: Personalized Farming Recommendations

## 1. Introduction

This feature is the intelligent core of Kheti Sahayak, designed to provide farmers with timely, data-driven, and personalized advice. Traditional farming often relies on generational knowledge, which, while valuable, may not be optimal for changing climatic and market conditions. By leveraging data from the farmer's own activities, local weather, and broader market trends, this feature aims to transform complex data into simple, actionable insights.

### 1.1 The Problem
- Farmers often make decisions based on intuition or incomplete information, leading to suboptimal yields and resource usage.
- Lack of access to tailored advice that considers their specific farm conditions (soil, water, crop history).
- Difficulty in keeping up with best practices, pest/disease prevention, and dynamic market demands.

### 1.2 User Stories
- As a farmer, I want to receive recommendations for the most profitable and suitable crops to plant for the upcoming season based on my farm's soil type, local weather patterns, and market prices.
- As a farmer, I want to get timely alerts and advice on when to irrigate, how much fertilizer to apply, and what preventive measures to take against common pests for my current crops.
- As a farmer with low literacy, I want these recommendations to be simple, in my local language, with clear icons and voice-over explanations.

## 2. Goals

*   Increase farmer profitability by recommending high-yield, high-demand crops.
*   Optimize the use of resources like water and fertilizers, promoting sustainable and cost-effective farming.
*   Reduce crop losses by providing proactive pest and disease alerts and preventive guidance.
*   Empower farmers to make confident, data-driven decisions for their entire crop cycle.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Data Ingestion & Processing
*   **FR3.1.1 Farm Profile Integration:** The system must ingest and process data from the user's Farm Profile, including soil type, crop history, farm size, and location.
*   **FR3.1.2 Weather Integration:** The system must use real-time and forecasted data from the Localized Weather Forecast feature.
*   **FR3.1.3 Marketplace Integration:** The system must pull data on market prices, demand trends, and input costs from the Marketplace feature.
*   **FR3.1.4 Logbook Integration:** The system must analyze historical data from the Digital Logbook, such as past yields, input usage, and recorded pest issues.

### 3.2 Recommendation Types
*   **FR3.2.1 Crop Recommendation:** The system must suggest 2-3 suitable crops for the upcoming season, including predicted yield, potential profit margin, and risk factors.
*   **FR3.2.2 Irrigation Advisory:** The system must provide a dynamic watering schedule (frequency and amount) based on crop type, growth stage, soil moisture data, and weather forecasts.
*   **FR3.2.3 Nutrient Management:** The system must recommend the type, quantity, and application schedule for fertilizers and micronutrients based on soil health reports and crop requirements.
*   **FR3.2.4 Proactive Pest & Disease Alerts:** The system must send predictive alerts for potential pest or disease outbreaks based on weather conditions, crop type, and regional outbreak data.
*   **FR3.2.5 Harvesting & Storage Guidance:** The system must advise on the optimal time to harvest for maximum quality and price, and provide best practices for post-harvest storage.

### 3.3 Recommendation Delivery
*   **FR3.3.1 Personalized Dashboard:** All recommendations must be displayed on a central, easy-to-understand dashboard within the app.
*   **FR3.3.2 Push Notifications:** Critical and time-sensitive advice (e.g., "Pest alert: High risk of aphids in your area") must be delivered via push notifications.

## 4. User Experience (UX) Requirements

*   **UX4.1 Simplicity and Clarity:** Recommendations must be presented in simple, non-technical language, using local dialects where possible. Icons and images should be used to aid understanding.
*   **UX4.2 Explainability:** Each recommendation must be accompanied by a simple "Why?" link or icon that provides a brief, clear rationale (e.g., "Recommended crop: Maize. Why? High market demand and suitable for your soil type.").
*   **UX4.3 Actionable Insights:** Recommendations should be directly actionable. For example, a fertilizer recommendation could link to the marketplace to buy the suggested product.
*   **UX4.4 Feedback Mechanism:** Users must be able to provide feedback on each recommendation (e.g., "Helpful," "Not Helpful," "Already Done"), which will be used to fine-tune the algorithms.
*   **UX4.5 Voice Support:** Key recommendations and their explanations must have a text-to-speech option for users with low literacy.

## 5. Technical Requirements / Considerations

*   **TR5.1 Recommendation Engine:** A hybrid engine combining a rules-based system (for standard agricultural practices) and machine learning models (for predictive insights) is required.
*   **TR5.2 ML Model Integration:** The system must integrate ML models for yield prediction, pest forecasting, and market price trends. These models will be hosted on a scalable platform (e.g., AWS SageMaker).
*   **TR5.3 Data Aggregation Service:** A backend microservice responsible for collecting, processing, and normalizing data from various internal and external sources in real-time.
*   **TR5.4 Scalability:** The recommendation engine must be designed to scale horizontally to handle millions of users, generating personalized advice with low latency.
*   **TR5.5 Continuous Learning:** The ML models must be designed for continuous retraining using new data from user logs and feedback to improve accuracy over time.

## 6. Security & Privacy Requirements

*   **SP6.1 Data Anonymization:** All personal and farm-specific data used for training aggregate models must be fully anonymized.
*   **SP6.2 User Consent:** Users must give explicit consent for their data (from logbooks, profiles) to be used for generating recommendations. The privacy policy must clearly state how this data is used.

## 7. KPIs & Impact Metrics

*   **Adoption Rate:** % of users who view and act upon a recommendation.
*   **Feedback Score:** Average user rating for the helpfulness of recommendations.
*   **Model Accuracy:** Measured accuracy of predictive models (e.g., pest forecast vs. actual occurrence).
*   **Reported Impact:** User-reported increase in yield, profit, or reduction in input costs (measured via surveys).

## 8. Rollout & Pilot Plan

- **Phase 1 (Validation):** Launch with a rule-based engine, validated by agricultural experts for two pilot districts.
- **Phase 2 (Pilot):** Introduce ML-based predictive models to the pilot group. Establish a control group to measure the feature's impact accurately.
- **Phase 3 (Scale):** Based on pilot results and model performance, roll out the feature to a wider audience, region by region.

## 9. Future Enhancements

*   **FE9.1 Financial Recommendations:** Suggest relevant crop insurance, credit products, or government subsidies based on the user's profile and activities.
*   **FE9.2 Sustainability Score:** Provide farmers with a score on the sustainability of their practices and offer recommendations to improve it.
*   **FE9.3 IoT Integration:** Integrate with on-farm IoT sensors (for soil moisture, local weather) to provide hyper-personalized, real-time advisories.
*   **FE9.4 Voice-based Interaction:** Allow farmers to ask the recommendation engine questions via voice command (e.g., "When should I water my wheat crop?").
