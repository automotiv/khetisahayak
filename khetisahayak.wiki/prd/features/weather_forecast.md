# Feature: Localized Weather Forecast

## 1. Introduction

Accurate and timely weather information is crucial for farmers to make informed decisions regarding planting, irrigation, harvesting, and protecting crops. In India, where microclimates can vary drastically even within a few kilometers, hyperlocal weather forecasts can help reduce crop losses, optimize resource use, and increase yields. Many farmers lack access to reliable, actionable weather data in their local language and context. This feature aims to provide precise, location-specific weather forecasts—delivered in a farmer-friendly manner—directly within the "Kheti Sahayak" app.

### 1.1 Why Hyperlocal Weather Matters for Indian Farmers
- Rainfall and temperature can vary dramatically between villages, affecting sowing and harvesting decisions.
- Timely alerts about storms, hail, or dry spells can prevent losses and enable protective actions.
- Localized weather data supports more accurate recommendations for irrigation, pesticide use, and disease management.

### 1.2 User Stories
- As a smallholder farmer, I want to receive weather alerts in my local language so I can take timely action to protect my crops.
- As a farmer with limited literacy, I want weather information presented with clear icons, voice output, and minimal text.
- As a user with multiple farm plots, I want to track weather for each location separately.
- As a user with intermittent connectivity, I want the app to show cached weather data with a clear timestamp.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide farmers with reliable current weather conditions and forecasts (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly).
*   Enable location-specific forecasts using GPS or manual location input.
*   Alert farmers about significant weather events (e.g., heavy rain, storms, heatwaves).
*   Integrate weather data seamlessly into other features like recommendations and alerts.
*   Support low-literacy and low-connectivity users through voice, icons, and offline caching.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Location Determination
*   **FR3.1.1 GPS Integration:** The system must utilize the device's GPS to determine the user's current location for fetching forecasts (requires user permission). (See also `prd/technical/gps_integration.md` [TODO: Create this file])
*   **FR3.1.2 Manual Location Input:** Users must be able to manually search and set one or more locations (e.g., farm location, home location) for which they want weather forecasts.
*   **FR3.1.3 Default Location:** Users must be able to set a default location for quick access.
*   **FR3.1.4 Edge Case:** If GPS is unavailable or denied, prompt for manual input and explain why location is needed.

### 3.2 Weather Data Display
*   **FR3.2.1 Current Conditions:** Display current temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction, precipitation status, and UV index for the selected location.
*   **FR3.2.2 Hourly Forecast:** Provide an hourly forecast for at least the next 24-48 hours, including temperature, precipitation probability/intensity, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rain).
*   **FR3.2.3 Daily Forecast:** Provide a daily forecast for at least the next 7-10 days, including min/max temperature, precipitation probability/amount, and general weather conditions.
*   **FR3.2.4 Extended Forecast:** [Optional] Consider providing a longer-range forecast (e.g., 14-30 days) if reliable data is available.
*   **FR3.2.5 Units:** Allow users to select preferred units (e.g., Celsius/Fahrenheit for temperature, mm/inches for precipitation, km/h / mph for wind).
*   **FR3.2.6 Accessibility:** Provide voice readout and high-contrast icons for key weather data.

### 3.3 Weather Alerts
*   **FR3.3.1 Severe Weather Notifications:** The system must send push notifications to users for severe weather warnings relevant to their selected location(s) (e.g., heavy rain, thunderstorms, high winds, frost alerts).
*   **FR3.3.2 Customizable Alerts:** Users should be able to customize which types of weather alerts they wish to receive.
*   **FR3.3.3 Alert Examples:**
    *   Heavy rainfall expected in next 24 hours
    *   High wind warning
    *   Heatwave alert
    *   Pest/disease risk due to weather

### 3.4 Data Source Integration
*   **FR3.4.1 Weather API Integration:** The system must integrate with one or more reliable third-party Weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherStack, AccuWeather, National Weather Services) to fetch data.
*   **FR3.4.2 API Key Management:** Securely manage API keys required for accessing weather services.
*   **FR3.4.3 Fallback Mechanism:** Implement a fallback mechanism (e.g., using a secondary API) in case the primary weather data source is unavailable.
*   **FR3.4.4 Example API Payload:**
```json
{
  "location": "Nashik, Maharashtra",
  "current": {
    "temp_c": 32,
    "humidity": 60,
    "precip_mm": 0.5,
    "wind_kph": 10,
    "uv": 8
  },
  "hourly": [...],
  "daily": [...]
}
```

## 4. User Experience (UX) Requirements

*   **UX4.1 Intuitive Interface:** Display weather information clearly using intuitive icons, graphs, and layouts. Example wireframe: [Weather card with icons for sun/rain, temperature, wind, and a voice button]
*   **UX4.2 Easy Navigation:** Allow easy switching between current, hourly, and daily forecasts.
*   **UX4.3 Location Management:** Simple interface for adding, deleting, and setting default locations.
*   **UX4.4 Readability:** Ensure good contrast and readable font sizes, considering potential use outdoors.
*   **UX4.5 Offline Access:** Cache the latest fetched weather data to display when the user is offline, clearly indicating the data's timestamp.
*   **UX4.6 Customization:** Allow users to customize the dashboard view (e.g., which data points are most prominent).
*   **UX4.7 Accessibility:** Support for screen readers and voice output in local languages.

## 5. Technical Requirements / Considerations

*   **TR5.1 API Selection Criteria:** Choose APIs based on accuracy, reliability, geographical coverage (especially rural India), data points offered, update frequency, cost, and API limits.
*   **TR5.2 Data Points Required:**
    *   *Essential:* Temperature (current, min/max), Humidity, Precipitation (probability, intensity, type), Wind Speed/Direction, Weather Condition Description/Icon.
    *   *Desirable:* UV Index, Air Quality Index (AQI), Soil Moisture (if available), Sunrise/Sunset times, Moon Phase.
*   **TR5.3 Data Caching:** Implement effective caching strategies to reduce API calls, improve performance, and manage costs. Example: Store last 48 hours of hourly data and last 10 days of daily data locally.
*   **TR5.4 Error Handling:** Gracefully handle API errors or unavailability, informing the user appropriately (e.g., "Could not fetch latest data").
*   **TR5.5 Scalability:** Ensure the backend can handle API requests efficiently as the user base grows.
*   **TR5.6 Battery Optimization:** Optimize GPS usage and background data fetching to minimize battery drain. (See `prd/technical/gps_integration.md`)
*   **TR5.7 Localization:** All weather data, alerts, and UI text must be available in supported local languages.

## 6. Security & Privacy Requirements

*   **SP6.1 Location Privacy:** Obtain explicit user consent before accessing GPS location. Clearly state how location data is used in the privacy policy. Do not share precise user coordinates unnecessarily with third parties.
*   **SP6.2 Secure API Calls:** Ensure API calls to weather services are made securely (e.g., using HTTPS).
*   **SP6.3 Data Handling:** Handle fetched weather data securely, especially if cached or stored.

## 7. KPIs & Impact Metrics
- % of active users who view weather daily
- % of users who receive and act on weather alerts
- Reduction in reported crop losses due to weather events (survey-based)
- User satisfaction with weather feature (survey/NPS)

## 8. Rollout & Pilot Plan
- Launch pilot in 2-3 districts with diverse climates
- Collect feedback from farmers on accuracy, usability, and language
- Iterate on alert thresholds and UI based on real-world usage

## 9. Future Enhancements

*   **FE9.1 Advanced Alerts:** Predictive alerts based on weather trends (e.g., potential drought conditions, optimal planting windows based on forecast).
*   **FE9.2 Historical Weather Data:** Allow users to view past weather data for their location.
*   **FE9.3 Integration with Recommendations:** Use forecast data to provide more accurate farming recommendations (e.g., irrigation scheduling, pest outbreak likelihood).
*   **FE9.4 Integration with Logbook:** Allow users to easily log weather conditions observed against their farm activities.

[TODO: Add specific API choices after research/decision.]
[TODO: Define specific alert thresholds and types.]
[TODO: Detail the exact data points to be displayed for each forecast type (current, hourly, daily).]
