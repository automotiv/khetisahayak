# Feature: Offline Functionality

## 1. Introduction

Many farmers in India operate in areas with unreliable or limited internet connectivity. The Offline Functionality feature ensures that "Kheti Sahayak" remains useful even when users are offline, by caching data and allowing certain actions to be performed locally, syncing them later when connectivity is restored.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide access to essential information (e.g., previously fetched weather, downloaded content, logbook entries) when offline.
*   Allow users to perform key actions (e.g., creating logbook entries) offline.
*   Ensure seamless synchronization of offline data/actions once connectivity is re-established.
*   Clearly communicate the offline status and data freshness to the user.
*   Optimize storage usage on the user's device.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Data Caching & Access
*   **FR3.1.1 Weather Forecast:** Cache the most recently fetched weather forecast data for the user's default location(s). Display this cached data when offline, clearly indicating the timestamp of the last update. (See `prd/features/weather_forecast.md`)
*   **FR3.1.2 Educational Content:** Allow users to explicitly download specific articles or videos for offline viewing. Manage downloaded content storage. (See `prd/features/educational_content.md`)
*   **FR3.1.3 Digital Logbook:** All logbook entries created by the user must be stored locally on the device and accessible offline. (See `prd/features/digital_logbook.md`)
*   **FR3.1.4 Farm Profile:** User's own farm profile data should be stored locally and viewable offline.
*   **FR3.1.5 Government Schemes:** [Optional] Cache basic details or bookmarked government schemes for offline viewing. (See `prd/features/govt_schemes.md`) [TODO: Decide scope of offline schemes for v1.0.]
*   **FR3.1.6 Other Data:** Identify other potentially useful data to cache (e.g., basic details of bookmarked marketplace items, expert profiles). [TODO: Define scope.]

### 3.2 Offline Actions
*   **FR3.2.1 Digital Logbook Entry:** Users must be able to create new logbook entries (including attaching photos/videos taken offline) while offline. These entries should be queued for syncing.
*   **FR3.2.2 Editing Local Data:** Allow editing of locally stored data like logbook entries or farm profile details while offline. Changes should be queued for syncing.
*   **FR3.2.3 Content Consumption:** Allow viewing of downloaded educational content.
*   **FR3.2.4 [Out of Scope for v1.0 - Likely]:** Real-time interactions like marketplace purchases, forum posting, expert chat, or equipment booking will likely require an active internet connection and may not be supported offline initially.

### 3.3 Data Synchronization
*   **FR3.3.1 Automatic Syncing:** When the device regains internet connectivity, the app must automatically sync any queued offline actions (new log entries, edits) with the server.
*   **FR3.3.2 Conflict Resolution:** Implement a strategy to handle potential data conflicts (e.g., if data was modified both offline and on the server). Options include "last write wins", prompting the user, or more sophisticated merging. [TODO: Define conflict resolution strategy.]
*   **FR3.3.3 Sync Status Indicator:** Provide clear visual feedback to the user about the sync status (e.g., syncing in progress, sync complete, sync failed).
*   **FR3.3.4 Manual Sync Option:** Allow users to manually trigger a sync if needed.
*   **FR3.3.5 Background Sync:** Perform synchronization in the background where possible, without requiring the app to be actively open (respecting OS limitations and battery).

### 3.4 Offline Status Indication
*   **FR3.4.1 Clear Indicator:** The app must clearly indicate to the user when it is operating in offline mode.
*   **FR3.4.2 Data Freshness:** When displaying cached data (like weather), clearly show the timestamp of the last successful update.
*   **FR3.4.3 Feature Availability:** Disable or clearly mark features that require an internet connection when the user is offline.

## 4. User Experience (UX) Requirements

*   **UX4.1 Seamless Transition:** The transition between online and offline modes should be as smooth as possible.
*   **UX4.2 Clear Communication:** Users should always understand if they are online or offline and how fresh the data they are seeing is.
*   **UX4.3 Reliability:** Offline actions (like saving log entries) must be reliably stored and synced later.
*   **UX4.4 Storage Management:** Provide users with visibility and control over downloaded content and offline data storage usage.

## 5. Technical Requirements / Considerations

*   **TR5.1 Local Storage:** Utilize appropriate on-device storage mechanisms (e.g., SQLite, Core Data, Realm, device file system) for caching data and queueing offline actions.
*   **TR5.2 Sync Logic:** Design a robust and efficient synchronization mechanism to handle data transfer and conflict resolution between the device and the server.
*   **TR5.3 Network Detection:** Implement reliable network connectivity detection.
*   **TR5.4 Background Processing:** Leverage platform capabilities for background data synchronization (respecting battery life and OS constraints).
*   **TR5.5 Data Size Management:** Optimize the amount of data cached to balance utility with device storage limitations.

## 6. Security & Privacy Requirements

*   **SP6.1 Secure Local Storage:** Encrypt sensitive data stored locally on the device.
*   **SP6.2 Secure Syncing:** Ensure data synchronization between the device and server occurs over secure channels (HTTPS).

## 7. Future Enhancements

*   **FE7.1 Expanded Offline Features:** Gradually enable more features to work offline (e.g., drafting forum posts, browsing cached marketplace listings).
*   **FE7.2 Selective Caching:** Allow users more granular control over what data gets cached for offline use.
*   **FE7.3 Peer-to-Peer Sync (Advanced):** Explore possibilities for syncing data directly between nearby devices in areas with no internet but local connectivity (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct).
