# Technical Requirement: AI/ML Integration

## 1. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are core technologies enabling key intelligent features within "Kheti Sahayak," primarily Crop Health Diagnostics and Personalized Farming Recommendations. This document outlines the high-level requirements and considerations for integrating AI/ML capabilities.

## 2. Goals

*   Leverage AI/ML to provide accurate crop disease/pest identification from images.
*   Utilize ML models to generate relevant, data-driven personalized recommendations for farmers.
*   Ensure AI/ML components are scalable, maintainable, and continuously improvable.
*   Build user trust through transparent (where possible) and reliable AI-driven insights.

## 3. AI/ML Applications & Requirements

### 3.1 Crop Health Diagnostics (Image Recognition)
*   **Requirement:** Develop or integrate an ML model (likely a Convolutional Neural Network - CNN) capable of identifying common crop diseases and pests relevant to Indian agriculture from user-uploaded images.
*   **Input:** User-uploaded images of crops.
*   **Output:** Identified disease/pest name(s), confidence score(s), potentially bounding boxes around affected areas.
*   **Model Selection (v1.0):**
    - Explore transfer learning with architectures such as MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, or ResNet for initial deployment (balance accuracy and inference speed for mobile).
    - Use pre-trained weights on ImageNet, fine-tuned on the curated crop dataset.
    - Evaluate YOLOv5/YOLOv8 or similar for object detection if bounding boxes are needed.
*   **Data Needs:** Requires a large, diverse, accurately labeled dataset of images covering target crops, diseases, pests, and varying conditions (lighting, angles, stages). Dataset curation and augmentation are critical.
*   **Data Sources:**
    - Public datasets (PlantVillage, iNaturalist, ICAR/Indian agri-institutes).
    - Partnership with local agri-universities for new images.
    - Crowdsourced images from pilot users (with consent).
*   **Labeling Strategy:**
    - Manual annotation by agri-experts for initial dataset.
    - Use labeling tools (CVAT, Labelbox, or custom UI).
    - Periodic expert review and correction of model predictions.
*   **Model Performance:**
    - Target: >85% top-1 accuracy, >0.80 precision/recall on test set.
    - Latency: <2s inference time for 95% of images on target devices.
    - [TODO: Refine targets after pilot.]
*   **Integration:** See `prd/features/crop_diagnostics.md`.

### 3.2 Personalized Farming Recommendations (Predictive Modeling & Recommendation Engine)
*   **Requirement:** Develop ML models and potentially rule-based systems to generate recommendations for crop selection, irrigation, fertilization, pest management, harvesting, and market timing.
*   **Input:** Farm Profile data, weather data, market data, historical logbook data, potentially aggregated community data, expert knowledge rules.
*   **Output:** Actionable recommendations tailored to the user's context.
*   **Model Types:** May involve various models:
    *   *Classification:* Predicting pest/disease likelihood.
    *   *Regression:* Predicting yield potential, optimal fertilizer amounts.
    *   *Time Series Analysis:* Forecasting market prices, weather impacts.
    *   *Collaborative Filtering/Content-Based Filtering:* For suggesting relevant content or practices based on similar users/farms.
*   **Data Needs:** Requires structured data from various integrated sources. Data quality and completeness are crucial.
*   **Integration:** See `prd/features/recommendations.md`.

### 3.3 [Future] Other Potential Applications
*   **Chatbots:** NLP for understanding user queries and providing initial responses.
*   **Yield Prediction:** More sophisticated models for accurate yield forecasting.
*   **Optimized Resource Allocation:** Models to suggest optimal use of water, fertilizer, etc.
*   **Automated Logbook Analysis:** Identify trends or anomalies in user logbook data.

## 4. Model Development & Training Lifecycle

*   **TR4.1 Data Collection & Preparation:**
    - Collect from public datasets, partners, and in-app user uploads (with consent).
    - Clean, deduplicate, and augment images (rotation, brightness, etc.).
    - Store dataset versions (e.g., with DVC or MLflow).
*   **TR4.2 Model Selection/Development:**
    - Use TensorFlow or PyTorch for prototyping and training.
    - Prefer models that can be exported to ONNX or TensorFlow Lite for edge/mobile deployment.
*   **TR4.3 Training & Validation:**
    - Use stratified train/val/test splits by crop and region.
    - Cross-validation for robust performance estimation.
*   **TR4.4 Hyperparameter Tuning:**
    - Use libraries like Optuna or Ray Tune for automated search.
*   **TR4.5 Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate on accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and inference latency.
    - [Example threshold: >85% accuracy, <2s latency.]
*   **TR4.6 Deployment:**
    - Deploy using cloud ML platforms (AWS SageMaker, GCP AI Platform) or custom Docker containers.
    - For mobile/edge: Convert to TensorFlow Lite or ONNX, test on target devices.
    - [TODO: Evaluate feasibility of edge deployment for offline/low-latency use.]
*   **TR4.7 Monitoring & Retraining:**
    - Monitor accuracy, drift, and user feedback in production.
    - Trigger retraining if accuracy drops >5% from baseline, or quarterly.
    - Use MLOps tools (MLflow, Kubeflow, ClearML) for pipeline automation.
    - Log all inference requests (anonymized) for continual improvement.

## 5. Infrastructure & Deployment

*   **TR5.1 Model Hosting:**
    - Cloud ML Platforms (AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform, Azure ML).
    - Dedicated servers with GPU support.
    - Edge deployment (on-device) for specific models if latency/offline capability is critical (consider model size and device constraints). [TODO: Evaluate feasibility of edge deployment.]
    - Fallback: If edge inference fails, queue for cloud processing when online.
*   **TR5.2 Scalability:** Ensure the inference infrastructure can scale to handle varying request loads.
*   **TR5.3 Latency:** Optimize model inference time to provide timely results to users (especially for diagnostics).
*   **TR5.4 MLOps:** Implement MLOps practices for managing the end-to-end ML lifecycle (data versioning, model versioning, automated training/deployment pipelines, monitoring).

## 6. Data Handling & Ethics

*   **SP6.1 Data Privacy:** User data used for training must be anonymized. Obtain explicit consent for using data (especially images) for model improvement.
*   **SP6.2 Bias & Fairness:** Actively audit datasets and models for potential biases (e.g., regional, crop-specific) and implement mitigation strategies to ensure fair and equitable outcomes. Document bias audits and mitigation steps.
*   **SP6.3 Transparency (Explainability):**
    - Where feasible, provide users with simple explanations for AI-driven recommendations or diagnoses to build trust.
    - Use techniques such as LIME or SHAP for internal validation and to generate user-facing explanations (e.g., "The diagnosis is based on white spots detected on leaves").
    - In the UI, show "Why this result?" info for transparency.
*   **SP6.4 Secure Data Storage:** Store training datasets and models securely.

## 7. Team & Expertise

*   Requires personnel with expertise in data science, machine learning engineering, data engineering, and domain knowledge (agriculture). Collaboration with agricultural experts is vital for data labeling, model validation, and defining relevant problems.

## 8. Pilot Plan & Feedback Loop

- Deploy initial model in 2-3 pilot districts.
- Collect real-world user images and feedback.
- Run expert validation on a sample of predictions.
- Iterate model and UI based on pilot findings.
- Use pilot data to expand/clean initial dataset and retrain.
