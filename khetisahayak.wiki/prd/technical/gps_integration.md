# Technical Requirement: GPS Integration

## 1. Introduction

GPS (Global Positioning System) integration is fundamental for providing location-aware services within "Kheti Sahayak," such as localized weather forecasts, proximity-based searches in the marketplace or sharing platform, and potentially for farm profile location mapping.

## 2. Goals

*   Accurately determine the user's current geographical location when required and permitted.
*   Enable features that rely on precise location data.
*   Optimize GPS usage for battery efficiency.
*   Ensure user privacy and control over location sharing.

## 3. Functional Requirements

*   **FR3.1 Location Permission:** The app must request user permission before accessing device location services. A clear explanation of why location access is needed must be provided.
*   **FR3.2 Current Location Fetching:** Ability to fetch the user's current location on demand (e.g., for weather forecast, finding nearby items).
*   **FR3.3 Accuracy Levels:** Support different accuracy levels (e.g., coarse, fine) depending on the feature's requirement, balancing precision with battery consumption. Target accuracy should be sufficient for farm-level localization (e.g., within 10-50 meters for fine accuracy).
*   **FR3.4 Manual Location Fallback:** Provide manual location search and selection as an alternative or supplement to GPS.
*   **FR3.5 Background Location (Optional/Limited):** Consider if any feature requires background location access (e.g., geo-fenced alerts). This requires careful justification, explicit user consent (including background permission prompts), and clear communication due to privacy implications and battery drain. [TODO: Define if background location is needed for v1.0.]

## 4. Technical Implementation

*   **TR4.1 Platform APIs:** Utilize native platform location services:
    *   **Android:** Google Location Services API (Fused Location Provider).
    *   **iOS:** Core Location Framework.
*   **TR4.2 Frequency of Updates:** Location updates should only be requested when actively needed by a feature to conserve battery. Avoid continuous tracking unless essential and explicitly enabled by the user.
*   **TR4.3 Error Handling:** Gracefully handle scenarios where location cannot be determined (e.g., GPS signal unavailable, user denied permission). Provide informative messages to the user.
*   **TR4.4 Alternative Methods:** In case of weak GPS signal, supplement with Wi-Fi triangulation or cell tower triangulation for approximate location, if feasible and appropriate for the required accuracy.

## 5. Performance & Optimization

*   **TR5.1 Battery Efficiency:** Prioritize low-power location modes when high accuracy is not essential. Request location updates judiciously.
*   **TR5.2 Caching:** Cache the last known location for a short duration to avoid redundant requests if needed again quickly.

## 6. Security & Privacy

*   **SP6.1 Explicit Consent:** Always obtain explicit user consent before accessing location.
*   **SP6.2 Transparency:** Clearly state in the privacy policy how location data is collected, used, stored, and potentially shared (e.g., with weather APIs).
*   **SP6.3 Data Minimization:** Only request the level of accuracy and frequency of updates necessary for the specific feature.
*   **SP6.4 Secure Transmission:** Encrypt location data when transmitting it to backend servers or third-party APIs.
*   **SP6.5 Anonymization:** If location data is used for analytics, ensure it is anonymized and aggregated.

## 7. Integration Points

*   Localized Weather Forecast (`prd/features/weather_forecast.md`)
*   Marketplace (Nearby listings) (`prd/features/marketplace.md`)
*   Equipment & Labor Sharing (Nearby rentals/labor) (`prd/features/sharing_platform.md`)
*   Farm Profile (Setting farm location) (`prd/features/farm_profile.md`)
*   [Optional] Geo-fenced Notifications (`prd/features/notifications.md`)

## 8. Future Enhancements

*   **FE8.1 Geo-fencing:** Implement geo-fencing for location-based alerts or automation.
*   **FE8.2 Farm Boundary Mapping:** Allow users to draw or walk farm boundaries using GPS for precise area calculation and mapping.
*   **FE8.3 Route Optimization (If applicable):** For potential logistics features, use location for route planning.

[TODO: Define specific accuracy requirements for different features.]
[TODO: Finalize decision on background location access for v1.0.]
