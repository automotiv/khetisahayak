# **2.2.5 Integration Points**

*(Note: This section lists key external services the platform needs to integrate with. Details for specific integrations are often found within the relevant feature or technical requirement files.)*

*   **TR2.2.5.1 Weather API:** Integration with one or more third-party weather APIs is required to provide localized forecasts. (See `prd/features/weather_forecast.md`). [TODO: Select specific API(s)].
*   **TR2.2.5.2 Payment Gateway:** Integration with a secure payment gateway is necessary for handling transactions within the Marketplace and potentially the Equipment/Labor Sharing features. Must support common Indian payment methods (UPI, Cards, Net Banking, Wallets). (See `prd/features/marketplace.md`). [TODO: Select specific gateway(s)].
*   **TR2.2.5.3 SMS Gateway:** Integration with an SMS gateway provider is required for sending OTPs for authentication and potentially other notifications. (See `prd/features/authentication.md`). [TODO: Select specific provider].
*   **TR2.2.5.4 Email Service (Optional):** Integration with an email service provider (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES) might be needed for sending transactional emails (e.g., password resets, invoices, optional notifications). [TODO: Decide if email integration is needed for v1.0].
*   **TR2.2.5.5 Map Service:** Integration with a map service (e.g., Google Maps Platform, Mapbox) is needed for displaying locations, potentially calculating proximity, and enabling map-based interactions (like farm boundary drawing). (See `prd/technical/gps_integration.md`). [TODO: Select specific map service(s)].
*   **TR2.2.5.6 Push Notification Services:** Integration with FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) for Android and APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) for iOS is required for delivering push notifications. (See `prd/features/notifications.md`).
*   **TR2.2.5.7 Government Scheme Data Sources:** Integration via API or RSS feeds with government portals or reliable sources to fetch scheme information. (See `prd/features/govt_schemes.md` and `prd/section_29_api_rss_integration.md`). [TODO: Identify specific sources].
*   **TR2.2.5.8 Translation Service (Optional):** If real-time dynamic translation is implemented, integration with a machine translation API (e.g., Google Cloud Translation) is needed. (See `prd/features/multilingual.md`).
*   **TR2.2.5.9 Video Conferencing/Webinar Platform (Optional):** If live video consultations or webinars are hosted directly via the app, integration with relevant SDKs/APIs (e.g., Zoom, Agora) might be required. (See `prd/features/expert_connect.md` and `prd/section_20_webinar_integrations.md`).
*   **TR2.2.5.10 External Calendar Sync (Optional):** Integration with calendar APIs (e.g., Google Calendar API) if external calendar syncing is supported. (See `prd/section_14_calendar_integration.md`).
