# **14 Calendar Integration in "Kheti Sahayak"**

### **2.14.1 Introduction**

Calendar integration is essential for the Equipment & Labor Sharing feature, providing a visual and interactive way to manage availability and bookings. It allows equipment owners and laborers to define when they are available, and renters/hirers to easily see and select suitable slots.

### **2.14.2 Key Features**

### **2.14.3 Date Selection & Availability Viewing**

*   **UX2.14.3.1 Availability Viewer:** Renters/hirers must be presented with a clear calendar interface (e.g., monthly view) showing available dates/slots for a specific piece of equipment or laborer.
*   **UX2.14.3.2 Visual Differentiation:** Use distinct visual cues (e.g., colors, patterns) to indicate available, booked, potentially unavailable (blocked by owner/laborer), and selected dates/slots.
*   **FR2.14.3.3 Date Range Selection:** Users must be able to easily select a start and end date/time for their desired booking period directly on the calendar.

### **2.14.4 Booking Slots**

*   **FR2.14.4.1 Time-Based Slots:** For items/labor available on an hourly basis, the calendar must support selecting specific time slots within a day.
*   **FR2.14.4.2 Day-Based Slots:** For daily or multi-day rentals, allow selection of full days.
*   **FR2.14.4.3 Minimum/Maximum Duration:** Enforce any minimum or maximum rental/hiring durations set by the owner/laborer during slot selection.

### **2.14.5 Notifications & Alerts Integration**

*   **FR2.14.5.1 Booking Confirmations:** Confirmed bookings must be visually reflected on the calendar immediately. Notifications should be sent (See `prd/features/notifications.md`).
*   **FR2.14.5.2 Reminder Alerts:** Integrate with the notification system to send reminders based on calendar booking dates (start/end times).

### **2.14.6 Sync with External Calendars (Optional)**

*   **FR2.14.6.1 Third-party Integration:** [Optional] Consider allowing users (especially owners/laborers) to sync their availability with external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar) via standard protocols (e.g., CalDAV, iCal import/export). [TODO: Decide scope for v1.0].

### **2.14.7 User Experience**

### **2.14.8 Intuitive Interface**

*   **UX2.14.8.1 Easy Interaction:** Calendar navigation (changing months, selecting dates) must be intuitive on mobile devices (e.g., swipes, taps). Consider drag-to-select for date ranges.
*   **UX2.14.8.2 Clarity:** Ensure dates, times, and availability status are clearly displayed.

### **2.14.9 Flexible Adjustments**

*   **FR2.14.9.1 Modify Bookings:** Provide a mechanism to request modifications to existing bookings (subject to availability and other party's approval), reflected in the calendar.
*   **UX2.14.9.2 Cancellation Visibility:** Clearly indicate cancellation policies when viewing or making bookings.

### **2.14.10 Backend Integration**

### **2.14.11 Real-time Updates**

*   **TR2.14.11.1 Dynamic Calendar:** The backend must ensure that calendar availability is updated in real-time across all user views as bookings are made or cancelled to prevent double bookings. Use appropriate database locking or transaction management.

### **2.14.12 History & Archives**

*   **TR2.14.12.1 Past Bookings:** Calendar data for past bookings should be retained and accessible (e.g., in user's booking history), though potentially visually distinct from future availability.
*   **FR2.14.12.2 Feedback Link:** Link calendar entries for completed rentals/hires to the rating/review system.

### **2.14.13 Challenges & Solutions** *(Considerations)*

### **2.14.14 Overlapping Bookings / Conflicts**

*   **TR2.14.14.1 Conflict Prevention:** Implement robust backend logic and database constraints to prevent double bookings for the same resource at the same time.
*   **UX2.14.14.2 Booking Buffer (Optional):** Consider allowing owners to set buffer times between rentals for preparation/handover, reflected as unavailable slots in the calendar.

### **2.14.15 User Error**

*   **UX2.14.15.1 Double Confirmation:** Implement a confirmation step before finalizing a booking, summarizing the selected dates/times.
*   **UX2.14.15.2 Clear Instructions:** Provide simple guidance or tooltips on how to use the calendar selection features.

### **2.14.16 Integration Options** *(Technical Choices)*

*   **TR2.14.16.1 Libraries/Components:** Utilize well-maintained third-party calendar libraries/components suitable for the chosen mobile development framework (React Native, Flutter, Native) to accelerate development and ensure a good UX. Examples: `react-native-calendars`, `syncfusion_flutter_calendar`, native platform components.
*   **TR2.14.16.2 External Sync APIs:** If external sync is implemented, use standard APIs like Google Calendar API.
