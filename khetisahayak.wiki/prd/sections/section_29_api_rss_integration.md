# **29 API or RSS Feeds Integration in "Kheti Sahayak"** 
*(Related to Government Scheme Portal)*

### **2.29.1 Introduction**

To ensure the Government Scheme Portal within "Kheti Sahayak" provides timely and accurate information, integration with external data sources is necessary. This section discusses the technical approaches using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or RSS (Really Simple Syndication) Feeds to fetch scheme details from official government sources or reliable third-party aggregators.

### **2.29.2 API Integration**

### **2.29.3 Definition**

*   **TR2.29.3.1 Mechanism:** APIs provide a structured way for "Kheti Sahayak" to programmatically request and receive specific data (e.g., scheme details, eligibility criteria, deadlines) directly from the source system's database (e.g., a government portal's API, if available).

### **2.29.4 Advantages**

*   **Real-time Data:** Often provides the most current information available from the source.
*   **Structured Data:** Data is typically received in a structured format (like JSON), making it easier to parse and display consistently within the app.
*   **Specific Queries:** Allows fetching specific data points rather than entire pages or feeds.

### **2.29.5 Considerations**

*   **Availability:** Official APIs for specific government schemes may not always be available or publicly documented.
*   **Reliability:** Dependency on the uptime and performance of the external API provider.
*   **Cost:** Some APIs might have usage costs or rate limits.
*   **Authentication:** May require API keys or authentication mechanisms for access.
*   **Maintenance:** Changes in the external API require corresponding updates in "Kheti Sahayak".

### **2.29.6 RSS Feeds Integration**

### **2.29.7 Definition**

*   **TR2.29.7.1 Mechanism:** RSS feeds are standardized XML files provided by websites (including some government departments or news portals) that list recent updates or articles, often with summaries and links to the full content. "Kheti Sahayak" can periodically check these feeds for new scheme announcements or updates.

### **2.29.8 Advantages**

*   **Standardisation:** RSS is a well-defined standard, making feeds relatively easy to parse.
*   **Simplicity:** Integration is often simpler than complex API integrations.
*   **Wider Availability:** Many news sites and government press release sections offer RSS feeds.

### **2.29.9 Considerations**

*   **Limited Data:** Feeds usually contain only summaries or titles, requiring users to click through to the original source for full details. Extracting structured data (like eligibility, deadlines) directly from a feed is often difficult or impossible.
*   **Update Frequency:** Feed updates depend on the source's publishing schedule and may not be real-time.
*   **Reliability:** Feeds can sometimes become inactive or change format without notice.

### **2.29.10 Best Practices for Integration (Applies to both API & RSS)**

### **2.29.11 Data Validation & Sanitization**

*   **TR2.29.11.1 Verification:** Implement checks to validate the structure and content of data received from external sources before storing or displaying it.
*   **TR2.29.11.2 Sanitization:** Sanitize fetched content (especially if it contains HTML) to prevent potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

### **2.29.12 Caching**

*   **TR2.29.12.1 Performance:** Cache fetched scheme data locally (on server or client) to reduce redundant calls to external sources, improve app performance, and handle temporary source unavailability. Define appropriate cache durations (Time-To-Live).

### **2.29.13 Fallback Mechanisms**

*   **TR2.29.13.1 Redundancy:** If possible, use multiple sources (e.g., an API and an RSS feed, or multiple feeds) for the same information to improve reliability.
*   **TR2.29.13.2 Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for failed API calls or feed parsing errors. Inform users if data might be outdated due to source issues.

### **2.29.14 User Notifications Integration**

*   **FR2.29.14.1 Alerts:** Trigger notifications to users when significant new schemes or updates relevant to them are fetched via API/RSS. (See `prd/features/notifications.md`).

### **2.29.15 Conclusion**

Choosing between API and RSS integration (or a hybrid approach, potentially combined with manual curation) depends on the availability, reliability, and richness of data from official sources. The primary goal is to leverage these mechanisms to keep the Government Scheme Portal accurate and up-to-date, minimizing the burden on farmers to track this information themselves. Careful implementation with robust error handling and caching is essential.
