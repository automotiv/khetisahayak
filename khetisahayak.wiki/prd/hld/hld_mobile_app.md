```mermaid
%% C4 Context Diagram for Mobile App
C4Context
    Person(user, "Farmer/User", "Uses the mobile app")
    Person(admin, "Admin", "Manages content and support")
    System(app, "Kheti Sahayak Mobile App", "Android/iOS app for farmers")
    System_Ext(backend, "Backend Services", "APIs, business logic, data storage")
    System_Ext(notification, "Notification Provider", "Push/SMS/Email notifications")

    user -> app : Uses app (Biometric/OTP login)
    admin -> backend : Admin APIs
    app -> backend : API calls (HTTPS)
    backend -> notification : Sends notifications
```

## Mobile App C4 Container Diagram

This diagram illustrates the main containers within the mobile app and its interactions with backend services.

```mermaid
%% C4 Container Diagram for Mobile App
C4Container
    System_Boundary(app, "Kheti Sahayak Mobile App") {
        Container(ui, "UI Layer", "Flutter/React Native", "User interface, navigation")
        Container(auth, "Auth Module", "Local/Backend", "Biometric, OTP, OAuth2")
        Container(storage, "Local Storage", "SQLite/Secure Storage", "Offline data, credentials")
        Container(sync, "Sync Engine", "Dart/JS", "Data sync with backend, conflict resolution")
        Container(security, "Security Module", "Native", "Encryption, privacy controls")
    }
    System_Ext(backend, "Backend Services")
    System_Ext(notification, "Notification Provider")
    Person(user, "Farmer/User")

    user -> ui : Interacts
    ui -> auth : Authenticates
    ui -> storage : Reads/writes offline data
    sync -> backend : Syncs data (HTTPS)
    backend -> notification : Sends notifications
    security -> storage : Encrypts/decrypts
```
