# HLD: Integration Points

## Overview
The platform integrates with several external services to provide core functionality. Each integration is secured, monitored, and designed for resilience.

## Major Integrations
- **Weather APIs:**
  - Real-time and forecast weather data from trusted providers.
  - Data normalization and caching for consistent user experience.
- **Payment Gateways:**
  - UPI, cards, wallets for seamless and secure transactions.
  - PCI DSS compliance and fraud detection mechanisms.
- **SMS/Email Providers:**
  - OTP for authentication, alerts, and notifications.
  - Fallback to alternate channels if delivery fails.
- **Translation APIs:**
  - Dynamic translation of static and user-generated content.
  - Support for major Indian languages and right-to-left scripts.
- **Government Data:**
  - Automated retrieval of schemes, advisories, and eligibility checks.
  - Verification of authenticity and periodic refresh.
