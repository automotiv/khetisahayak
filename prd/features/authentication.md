# Feature: User Authentication & Profile Management

## 1. Introduction

This section defines the requirements for user registration, login, authentication, and basic profile management within the "Kheti Sahayak" application. Secure and reliable authentication is fundamental for accessing personalized features and protecting user data.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide a secure and user-friendly way for users (farmers, experts, vendors) to register and log in.
*   Protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
*   Enable users to manage their basic profile information and password.
*   Support different authentication methods suitable for the target audience.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 User Registration
*   **FR3.1.1 Registration Methods:** Support registration primarily via mobile number (using OTP verification) as it's most accessible for the target audience. [Optional] Consider email+password registration as a secondary method. [TODO: Confirm registration methods for v1.0.]
*   **FR3.1.2 Mobile Number Registration:**
    *   User enters a valid mobile number.
    *   System sends a One-Time Password (OTP) via SMS to the provided number.
    *   User enters the received OTP to verify the number.
    *   Upon successful verification, the user sets up their basic profile (Name, potentially User Type selection - Farmer/Expert/Vendor).
*   **FR3.1.3 Password Requirements (If applicable):** If email/password registration is used, enforce minimum password complexity requirements (length, character types).
*   **FR3.1.4 User Type Selection:** During registration or initial profile setup, allow users to identify their primary role (Farmer, Expert, Vendor) if not automatically determined. [TODO: Define how user type is set/verified.]
*   **FR3.1.5 Terms & Conditions/Privacy Policy:** Users must accept the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy during registration.

### 3.2 User Login
*   **FR3.2.1 Login Methods:**
    *   **Mobile + OTP:** User enters their registered mobile number, receives an OTP via SMS, and enters it to log in. This is often preferred for simplicity.
    *   **Mobile/Email + Password (If applicable):** User enters registered mobile/email and password.
*   **FR3.2.2 Remember Me (Optional):** Provide an option to keep the user logged in for a certain duration (using secure session management).
*   **FR3.2.3 Failed Login Attempts:** Lock the account temporarily after a specified number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

### 3.3 Password Management (If password login is used)
*   **FR3.3.1 Forgot Password:** Provide a secure mechanism for users to reset their password (e.g., via OTP sent to registered mobile number or link sent to registered email).
*   **FR3.3.2 Change Password:** Allow logged-in users to change their password securely (requiring current password confirmation).

### 3.4 Session Management
*   **FR3.4.1 Secure Sessions:** Implement secure session management (e.g., using tokens like JWT) to keep users logged in across app uses.
*   **FR3.4.2 Session Timeout:** Implement appropriate session timeout durations for security.
*   **FR3.4.3 Logout:** Provide a clear logout option. Invalidate session tokens upon logout.

### 3.5 Basic Profile Management
*   **FR3.5.1 View Profile:** Allow users to view their basic profile information (Name, registered mobile/email, user type).
*   **FR3.5.2 Edit Profile:** Allow users to edit basic profile information like their Name. Changing registered mobile/email might require re-verification. [TODO: Define which profile fields are editable.]
*   **FR3.5.3 Profile Picture (Optional):** Allow users to upload and update a profile picture.

## 4. User Experience (UX) Requirements

*   **UX4.1 Simple Registration/Login:** Make the processes quick, intuitive, and minimize required steps. OTP login is generally simpler for the target audience.
*   **UX4.2 Clear Error Messages:** Provide helpful feedback for invalid inputs or login failures (e.g., "Invalid OTP", "Incorrect Password", "Account locked").
*   **UX4.3 Accessibility:** Ensure input fields and buttons are easily usable, especially on mobile devices.

## 5. Technical Requirements / Considerations

*   **TR5.1 Secure Password Storage:** If passwords are used, store them securely using strong, salted hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2). Never store passwords in plain text.
*   **TR5.2 OTP Generation & Delivery:** Use a reliable SMS gateway provider for OTP delivery. Ensure OTPs are time-limited and securely generated. Implement rate limiting for OTP requests.
*   **TR5.3 Session Management Implementation:** Use industry-standard practices for token generation, storage (secure client-side storage), validation, and expiry.
*   **TR5.4 Scalability:** The authentication system must handle login/registration requests efficiently as the user base grows.

## 6. Security Requirements

*   **SR6.1 Brute Force Protection:** Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.
*   **SR6.2 OTP Security:** Protect against OTP interception or reuse.
*   **SR6.3 Session Hijacking Prevention:** Implement measures to prevent session tokens from being stolen or misused.
*   **SR6.4 Secure Password Reset:** Ensure the password reset process cannot be easily exploited.
*   **SR6.5 Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## 7. Future Enhancements

*   **FE7.1 Social Login:** Allow login/registration via third-party providers like Google or Facebook (consider privacy implications).
*   **FE7.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Offer additional security layers beyond OTP/password.
*   **FE7.3 Account Deletion:** Provide a mechanism for users to request deletion of their account and associated data.

[TODO: Finalize authentication methods (OTP mandatory? Password optional?).]
[TODO: Define account lockout policy (attempts, duration).]
[TODO: Specify session timeout duration.]
[TODO: Detail the process for changing registered mobile/email.]
