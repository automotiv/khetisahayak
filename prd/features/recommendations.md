# Feature: Personalized Farming Recommendations

## 1. Introduction

This feature aims to provide farmers with tailored, data-driven advice to optimize their farming practices, improve yield, enhance sustainability, and increase profitability. Recommendations leverage user-specific farm profiles, real-time environmental data, market trends, and machine learning algorithms.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide actionable recommendations for crop selection, irrigation, fertilization, pest/disease management, harvesting, and market timing.
*   Personalize recommendations based on individual farm characteristics (soil, location, history, equipment).
*   Integrate various data sources (user input, weather, market, community) for holistic advice.
*   Continuously improve recommendation accuracy and relevance through machine learning and user feedback.
*   Present recommendations in an easily understandable and actionable format.

## 3. Functional Requirements

    *   Basic Information (Location, Size).
    *   Crop Details (Current, History, Rotation).
    *   Soil Information (Type, Test Results - pH, nutrients).
    *   Water Source & Irrigation Methods.
    *   Equipment & Infrastructure Owned.
    *   Labor Details (Permanent, Seasonal).
    *   [TODO: Define mandatory vs. optional fields for profile completion.]
*   **FR3.1.2 Profile Updates:** Users must be able to easily update their profile information as conditions change (e.g., new soil test, new equipment).

### 3.2 Data Integration (Input Sources)
*   **FR3.2.1 Farm Profile Data:** The system must utilize the user's detailed farm profile data.
*   **FR3.2.2 Weather Data:** Integrate real-time and forecasted weather data for the farm's location. (See `prd/features/weather_forecast.md`)
*   **FR3.2.3 Market Data:** Integrate real-time or near-real-time market prices and demand trends for relevant crops. [TODO: Define specific market data sources/APIs.]
*   **FR3.2.4 User Activity Data:** Utilize data from the user's Digital Logbook (if used) regarding past activities and yields. (See `prd/features/digital_logbook.md`)
*   **FR3.2.5 Community Data:** [Optional] Incorporate anonymized, aggregated data or insights from the Community Forum regarding successful practices in similar conditions. (See `prd/features/community_forum.md`)
*   **FR3.2.6 Expert Knowledge:** Incorporate validated best practices and knowledge from agricultural experts.
*   **FR3.2.7 External Research Data:** [Optional] Integrate findings from relevant agricultural research databases or publications.

### 3.3 Recommendation Generation (Algorithmic Functionality)
*   **FR3.3.1 Data Processing:** Standardize and clean input data from various sources.
*   **FR3.3.2 Predictive Modeling:** Employ ML models to predict outcomes like yield potential, pest/disease likelihood, optimal harvest times, market price fluctuations. (See `prd/technical/ai_ml.md`)
*   **FR3.3.3 Recommendation Engine:** Generate specific, actionable recommendations based on model outputs and predefined rules/heuristics. Types of recommendations include:
    *   **Crop Selection:** Suggest suitable crops based on soil, climate, historical performance, market demand, and resistance factors.
    *   **Irrigation Scheduling:** Advise on optimal watering frequency and amount based on crop needs, soil moisture, and weather forecast.
    *   **Fertilization Plan:** Recommend type, amount, and timing of fertilizer application based on soil tests and crop requirements.
    *   **Pest & Disease Management:** Provide alerts for potential outbreaks based on weather and regional data; suggest preventive and treatment measures (IPM focused).
    *   **Harvesting Guidance:** Recommend optimal harvest timing based on crop maturity indicators and market prices.
    *   **Storage Advice:** Offer tips for post-harvest handling and storage based on crop type and available facilities.
    *   **Market Timing:** Suggest optimal times to sell produce based on price trends and demand forecasts.
*   **FR3.3.4 Continuous Learning:** The recommendation engine must incorporate user feedback and observed outcomes to refine its algorithms and improve accuracy over time.

### 3.4 Recommendation Display
*   **FR3.4.1 Dashboard Integration:** Display key recommendations prominently on the user's main dashboard.
*   **FR3.4.2 Dedicated Section:** Provide a dedicated section within the app to view all current and past recommendations.
*   **FR3.4.3 Clear Rationale:** Each recommendation must be accompanied by a simple explanation of the reasoning behind it (e.g., "Recommend watering tomorrow due to high temperatures and no rain forecast").
*   **FR3.4.4 Action Links:** Provide direct links to relevant actions (e.g., link to marketplace for recommended fertilizer, link to logbook to record action taken).

### 3.5 User Feedback
*   **FR3.5.1 Feedback Mechanism:** Allow users to provide feedback on the relevance and effectiveness of each recommendation (e.g., thumbs up/down, simple rating, "Did you follow this advice?").
*   **FR3.5.2 Outcome Reporting:** [Optional] Allow users to report the outcome if they followed a recommendation (e.g., "Yield increased after following fertilization plan").

## 4. User Experience (UX) Requirements

*   **UX4.1 Simplicity:** Present recommendations clearly and concisely, avoiding technical jargon. Use visuals (icons, charts) where appropriate.
*   **UX4.2 Timeliness:** Deliver recommendations at the appropriate time for action (e.g., irrigation advice before the need arises).
*   **UX4.3 Trustworthiness:** Build trust by providing rationale and citing data sources (where applicable).
*   **UX4.4 Customization:** Allow users some level of control over the types or frequency of recommendations they receive.
*   **UX4.5 Accessibility:** Ensure recommendations are accessible via multiple formats (text, potentially voice).

## 5. Technical Requirements / Considerations

*   **TR5.1 Algorithm Complexity:** Balance the complexity of algorithms with performance and interpretability. Start with simpler models/rules and iterate.
*   **TR5.2 Data Quality & Availability:** The accuracy of recommendations heavily depends on the quality and availability of input data (especially user-provided farm profile data and reliable external sources).
*   **TR5.3 Scalability:** The recommendation engine must scale to handle a large number of users and diverse data inputs.
*   **TR5.4 Modularity:** Design the engine modularly to easily add new data sources or recommendation types.
*   **TR5.5 Validation:** Rigorously validate algorithms and recommendations against expert knowledge and real-world data before deployment.

## 6. Security & Privacy Requirements

*   **SP6.1 Data Privacy:** User farm profile data and activity logs are sensitive. Ensure data is stored securely and anonymized/aggregated before being used for broader model training or community insights. Obtain explicit consent for data usage.
*   **SP6.2 Secure Integrations:** Ensure secure data transfer when integrating with external APIs (weather, market).

## 7. Future Enhancements

*   **FE7.1 Financial Recommendations:** Provide advice on budgeting, loan options, and insurance based on farm activities and market conditions.
*   **FE7.2 Sustainability Score:** Offer recommendations focused on improving the farm's environmental sustainability score.
*   **FE7.3 Deeper AI Integration:** Use more advanced AI techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning) to optimize complex farming strategies over time.
*   **FE7.4 Scenario Planning:** Allow users to explore "what-if" scenarios (e.g., "What if I plant Crop B instead of Crop A?").
