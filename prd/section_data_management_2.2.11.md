# **2.2.11 Data Management** 
*(Incorporates content from original 2.3.7 Data Handling & Storage)*

*(Note: This section outlines principles for managing application data. Specific database choices are in `prd/section_architecture_2.2.3.md` and security aspects in NFRs/feature files.)*

### **2.2.11.1 Introduction**
Effective data management is crucial for "Kheti Sahayak" to ensure data integrity, availability, security, and usability for features like recommendations, analytics, and user record-keeping. This covers the lifecycle of data from collection to archival/deletion.

### **2.2.11.2 Data Collection**
*   **TR2.2.11.2.1 Structured Collection:** Data input (e.g., Farm Profile, Logbook entries) should be structured using predefined fields and formats where possible to ensure consistency.
*   **TR2.2.11.2.2 Automated Collection:** Utilize automated processes for collecting data from external sources (e.g., Weather API, Government Scheme feeds) via defined integration points.
*   **TR2.2.11.2.3 User Consent:** Obtain explicit user consent before collecting personal or farm-specific data, clearly explaining its purpose.

### **2.2.11.3 Data Storage**
*   **TR2.2.11.3.1 Database Selection:** Choose appropriate database technologies (Relational, NoSQL) based on the data structure and query patterns (See Architecture).
*   **TR2.2.11.3.2 Scalability:** Ensure database solutions can scale to handle growing data volumes.
*   **TR2.2.11.3.3 Redundancy & Backup:** Implement regular automated backups and ensure database redundancy (e.g., using managed cloud database services) to prevent data loss and ensure high availability. (See NFRs).
*   **TR2.2.11.3.4 Secure Storage:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest. Implement appropriate access controls at the database level. (See NFRs).

### **2.2.11.4 Data Retrieval**
*   **TR2.2.11.4.1 Optimized Queries:** Design efficient database schemas and implement optimized queries with appropriate indexing to ensure fast data retrieval for application features.
*   **TR2.2.11.4.2 Caching:** Utilize caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times.

### **2.2.11.5 Data Security**
*   *(Covered extensively in NFRs and specific feature security requirements, e.g., Encryption, Access Control, Anonymization).*

### **2.2.11.6 Data Archival & Deletion**
*   **TR2.2.11.6.1 Archival Strategy:** Define a strategy for archiving historical data (e.g., old logbook entries, past weather data) that is no longer frequently accessed but may be needed for long-term analysis or compliance. Consider using cheaper storage tiers (e.g., data lakes, cold storage). [TODO: Define archival policy].
*   **TR2.2.11.6.2 Data Retention Policy:** Define how long different types of data (user accounts, logs, transaction history) will be retained, complying with legal requirements and user privacy. [TODO: Define retention policy].
*   **TR2.2.11.6.3 User Data Deletion:** Provide a mechanism for users to request the deletion of their account and associated personal data, in compliance with privacy regulations.

### **2.2.11.7 Data Integrity**
*   **TR2.2.11.7.1 Validation Checks:** Implement data validation rules at the point of input (client-side) and processing (server-side) to maintain data quality.
*   **TR2.2.11.7.2 Consistency:** Ensure data consistency across different modules (e.g., using foreign keys in relational databases, managing eventual consistency in distributed systems).
*   **TR2.2.11.7.3 Regular Audits (Optional):** Consider periodic data quality audits to identify and rectify inconsistencies or errors.

### **2.2.11.8 Compliance & Regulations**
*   **SP2.2.11.8.1 Data Protection Laws:** All data management practices must comply with applicable data protection laws (e.g., India's DPDP Act).
*   **SP2.2.11.8.2 Transparency:** Maintain a clear privacy policy informing users about data collection, usage, storage, and sharing practices.

### **2.2.11.9 Data Migration**
*   **TR2.2.11.9.1 Planning:** If migrating from existing systems or performing major schema changes, plan the data migration process carefully, including testing and rollback strategies.
