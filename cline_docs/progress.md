# Progress: Kheti Sahayak PRD Structuring

## What works / What's Done

*   **Initial Analysis:** The source document `Kheti Sahayak (1) 1.md` has been analyzed.
*   **PRD Structure Created:** A structured set of Markdown files for the Product Requirement Document has been created within the `prd/` directory. This includes:
    *   Introduction (`prd/00_introduction.md`)
    *   User Profiles (`prd/01_user_profiles.md`)
    *   Features Overview (`prd/02_features_overview.md`)
    *   Detailed Feature Files (`prd/features/...`) covering all major functionalities identified.
    *   Detailed Subsection Files (`prd/section_...`) covering specific aspects of features as detailed in the original document's structure.
    *   Non-Functional Requirements (`prd/03_non_functional_requirements.md`)
    *   Technical Requirements (`prd/technical/...`) for GPS and AI/ML.
    *   Design Requirements (`prd/design/ui_ux.md`).
*   **Content Extraction:** Content relevant to each section/feature has been extracted from the source document and placed into the corresponding new Markdown file.
*   **Styling:** Files created *after* the user's feedback (`prd/section_...` files) follow the original document's heading and numbering style (e.g., `# 10...`, `### 2.10.x`). Files created *before* the feedback (`prd/00...`, `prd/features/...`, `prd/technical/...`, `prd/design/...`) use a different heading style (`# Feature...`, `## 1. Introduction...`) but include requirement prefixes (`FR`, `TR`, etc.). [Note: User requested not to modify these earlier files again].
*   **TODOs Added:** Placeholders `[TODO: ...]` have been added throughout the PRD files to indicate areas requiring further definition, clarification, or decisions.
*   **Memory Bank Setup:** Core Memory Bank files (`cline_docs/productContext.md`, `cline_docs/activeContext.md`, `cline_docs/systemPatterns.md`, `cline_docs/techContext.md`) have been created based on the structured PRD information.

## What's left to build / Next Steps (for this task)

1.  Create this final Memory Bank file (`cline_docs/progress.md`).
2.  Use `attempt_completion` to report the successful structuring of the PRD into multiple Markdown files and the creation of the Memory Bank.

## Progress Status

*   **Task:** Create multiple markdown files based on type and sections for better maintainability and easy readability from `Kheti Sahayak (1) 1.md`.
*   **Status:** **Complete.** The original document has been successfully restructured into a set of organized Markdown files within the `prd/` directory, following the requested styling for newly created files. The Memory Bank context files have also been established.
*   **Note:** There's a stylistic inconsistency between files created before and after the user's feedback regarding heading/numbering format, as per the user's instruction not to modify the earlier files. The content itself has been extracted and organized. The next logical step would be to address the `[TODO: ...]` items within the PRD files to add missing details.
