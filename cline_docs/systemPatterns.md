# System Patterns: Kheti Sahayak

This document outlines the high-level architectural patterns and key technical decisions for the Kheti Sahayak platform, based on the initial PRD structuring.

## Architecture Overview

*   **Platform:** Mobile-first application (iOS & Android), potentially supplemented by a web portal for admin/vendor functions.
*   **Architecture Style:** Modular backend architecture hosted on the cloud (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure suggested) to support scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance. Multi-tier architecture (Frontend, Business Logic/API, Data Layer) is implied.
*   **Frontend:** Cross-platform framework (React Native or Flutter suggested) for mobile apps. Standard web technologies for any web portal.
*   **Backend:** API-driven (RESTful APIs). Technology choice like Node.js or Django mentioned as possibilities. Middleware for common concerns.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for structured data (users, profiles, orders, agreements, schemes).
    *   NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB) potentially for less structured data (forum posts, chat history, logs).
    *   Cloud object storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage) for media files (images, videos).
    *   Caching layer (Redis, Memcached) for performance optimization.

## Key Technical Decisions & Patterns

*   **Authentication:** Primarily Mobile Number + OTP based authentication. Secure session management (e.g., JWT). Secure password handling if password auth is added.
*   **Location Services:** Reliance on native platform GPS APIs (Google Location Services, iOS Core Location). Manual input fallback. Careful management of accuracy vs. battery life.
*   **AI/ML Integration:** Cloud-hosted ML models (CNNs for image recognition, various models for recommendations) accessed via APIs. Requires MLOps practices for lifecycle management (data collection, training, deployment, monitoring, retraining). User feedback loop is crucial.
*   **Real-time Features:** WebSockets or similar for real-time chat. Push notifications via FCM/APNS.
*   **Offline Support:** Client-side storage (SQLite, etc.) for caching data (weather, content, logbook) and queueing offline actions. Requires robust data synchronization logic with conflict resolution.
*   **Multilingual Support:** Internationalization (i18n) framework separating strings from code. Localization (L10n) process involving translation management. Font support for Indian languages.
*   **External Integrations:** API/RSS integration for Weather data and Government Schemes. Payment Gateway integration for Marketplace/Sharing features. Potential for external calendar sync and video conferencing/webinar platforms.
*   **Content Management:** A backend CMS is required for managing educational content uploads, categorization, and potentially moderation.
*   **Search:** Requires optimized database queries and potentially dedicated search indexing technology (e.g., Elasticsearch) for Marketplace and Educational Content.
*   **Scalability:** Achieved through cloud hosting, load balancing, auto-scaling, and efficient database/cache usage.
*   **Security:** Emphasis on data encryption (transit/rest), secure authentication/authorization (RBAC), input validation, API security, dependency management, and regular audits. Privacy compliance is key.
*   **Deployment:** CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment. Monitoring and logging are essential for operations.
