# Product Context: Kheti Sahayak

## Why this project exists

"Kheti Sahayak" aims to empower Indian farmers by bridging informational and transactional gaps in the agricultural sector using digital solutions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive mobile platform assisting farmers in various dimensions of farming, from planning and cultivation to harvesting and selling.

*   Difficulty in diagnosing crop diseases/pests accurately and quickly.
*   Need for personalized advice tailored to specific farm conditions.
*   Inefficiencies in accessing agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizers) and selling produce.
*   Underutilization of expensive farm equipment and challenges in finding temporary labor.
*   Limited access to verified agricultural experts.
*   Lack of structured digital record-keeping for farm activities.
*   Difficulty in discovering and understanding relevant government schemes.
*   Language barriers hindering access to information for diverse farming communities.
*   Challenges due to poor internet connectivity in rural areas.
