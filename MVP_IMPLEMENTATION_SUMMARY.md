## üöÄ Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub

```bash
# The commits are ready, but need to be pushed
git log --oneline -3

# You should see:
# 770db3c8 docs(lean): add comprehensive lean execution plan...
# 98fccfc9 feat(mvp): implement ML integration and treatment recommendations...

# Push with your credentials:
git push origin main
```

### 2. Run Database Migrations

```bash
cd kheti_sahayak_backend

# Run migrations
npm run migrate:up

# Seed treatment data
node seedTreatmentData.js

# Expected output:

# ‚úì Inserted 16 diseases total
# ‚úì Inserted 45+ treatments
```

### 3. Start ML Service

```bash
cd ml
source venv/bin/activate
python inference_service.py

# Should start on http://localhost:8000
# Test: curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### 4. Start Backend API
