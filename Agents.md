# Software Platform - Development Standards

## üöÄ Using CodeRabbit for Development

Always use CodeRabbit for:
- Automated code reviews and suggestions
- Enforcing coding standards and best practices
- Detecting bugs, vulnerabilities, and anti-patterns
- Generating documentation and code comments
- Refactoring and improving code quality
- Reviewing pull requests before merging

**Instruction:**
> Every developer must run CodeRabbit on all new code, changes, and pull requests. Address all issues and suggestions raised by CodeRabbit before finalizing any code merge or deployment.

This document defines the coding standards and best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and adaptable software platforms.

## üèóÔ∏è **Platform Architecture Principles**

### **Universal Platform Vision**
- **Multi-Domain Support:** Every feature must be designed to work across different business domains.
- **Category Agnostic:** Features should be universally applicable and not tied to a specific domain.
- **Scalable Design:** Architecture must support rapid expansion to new domains or use cases.
- **Consistent Experience:** Maintain uniform user experience across all platform modules.

### **Environment-First Development**
- **Environment Separation:** Clear separation between local, development, staging, and production environments.
- **Configuration Externalization:** All environment-specific settings must be externalized.
- **Cloud Ready:** Native support for cloud services and integrations.
- **Security by Design:** No hardcoded credentials, proper secret management.

## üìú **Code Readability and Style**

* **Clarity over cleverness:** Write code that is easy to understand, even if it's not the shortest possible solution.
* **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. A good name should explain its purpose without needing extra comments.
* **Consistency:** Adhere to a consistent coding style throughout the project (e.g., variable naming, indentation, brace placement). Use a linter to enforce style rules automatically.
* **Domain-Driven Naming:** Use terminology that reflects the platform's vocabulary.

***

## üß± **SOLID Principles for Software Platforms**

The SOLID principles are essential for building maintainable, scalable platforms that can serve multiple domains effectively.

### **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

* **A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.**
* **Application:** Each service should handle one specific capability (e.g., catalog management, order processing, payment handling)
* **Domain Agnostic Design:** Services should not be tied to specific domains but should be universally applicable
* **File Structure:** If a class's length is increasing, it's a strong indicator that it's taking on too many responsibilities. Refactor these responsibilities into new, focused classes, and place each new class in its own file.
* **Example:** `FeedService` should only handle feed generation logic, while `UniversalFeedService` should handle common feed logic.

### **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

* **Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.**
* **Platform Extensibility:** New domains should be added without modifying existing core platform code
* **Feature Extensions:** New features should be pluggable into the existing platform architecture
* **Implementation:** Use interfaces and abstract classes to define contracts that can be extended for new domains
* **Example:** `FeedPublisher` interface can be extended for new domains without modifying existing implementations.

### **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

* **Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.**
* **Domain Interchangeability:** Any domain-specific implementation should be replaceable with another without breaking the platform
* **Service Substitution:** Platform services should work consistently regardless of the specific domain implementation
* **Example:** Any `DomainFeedService` implementation should work seamlessly with the `UniversalFeedProcessor`.

### **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

* **Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.**
* **Domain-Specific Interfaces:** Create specific interfaces for each domain's unique requirements
* **Platform Interfaces:** Keep platform-level interfaces focused on common functionality
* **Example:** `CatalogService` should not depend on unrelated domain interfaces.

### **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

* **High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.**
* **Platform Independence:** High-level platform services should not depend on specific domain implementations
* **Cloud Service Abstraction:** Platform should depend on cloud service abstractions, not specific implementations
* **Configuration Abstraction:** Services should depend on configuration abstractions, not specific environment implementations
* **Example:** `FeedProcessor` should depend on `ConfigurationService` interface, not specific YAML or properties implementations.

## ‚úçÔ∏è **Documentation Standards for Software Platforms**

### **API Documentation**
* **OpenAPI/Swagger:** All REST APIs must be documented with OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
* **Domain-Specific APIs:** Document APIs that are specific to business domains separately
* **Platform APIs:** Document common platform APIs that work across all domains
* **Integration Documentation:** Document all external service integrations (e.g., Azure Service Bus, Kafka, Cosmos DB)

### **Code Documentation**
* **Why, not What:** Comments should explain *why* a piece of code exists, its design choices, or complex business logic. The code itself should explain *what* it does.
* **Business Context:** Document business rules and domain-specific logic clearly
* **Class and Method-Level Comments:** Every class and public method should have JavaDoc explaining its purpose, arguments, return values, and any exceptions it might raise.
* **Configuration Documentation:** Document all environment-specific configurations and their purposes
* **Integration Points:** Document all external service integration points and their contracts

### **Architecture Documentation**
* **Platform Architecture:** Document the overall platform architecture and how different domains integrate
* **Service Dependencies:** Document service dependencies and data flow
* **Environment Configuration:** Document environment setup and configuration management
* **Deployment Documentation:** Document deployment procedures for different environments

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud and Environment Configuration Standards**

### **Environment Management**
* **Profile-Based Configuration:** Use Spring profiles (local, dev, sit, prod) for environment-specific configurations
* **Externalized Configuration:** All sensitive data must be externalized using environment variables
* **Cloud Integration:** Leverage cloud provider's secret management for production secret management
