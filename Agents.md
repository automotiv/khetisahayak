   ```

#### **Step 4: Agricultural Domain-Specific Checks**
**CodeRabbit must validate these Kheti Sahayak specific requirements:**

1. **Crop Data Validation:**
   ```typescript
   // CodeRabbit should flag missing validation
   interface CropData {
     type: string;        // ‚ùå Should validate against known crop types
     season: string;      // ‚ùå Should validate Kharif/Rabi/Zaid
     region: string;      // ‚ùå Should validate Indian states/regions
   }
   
   // ‚úÖ Correct implementation
   interface CropData {
     type: CropType;      // Enum with valid crops
     season: Season;      // Enum with Indian seasons
     region: IndianRegion; // Enum with states/regions
   }
   ```

2. **Weather Data Security:**
   ```java
   // ‚ùå CodeRabbit should flag this
   @GetMapping("/weather")
   public WeatherData getWeather(@RequestParam String location) {
     // No validation - security risk
   }
   
   // ‚úÖ CodeRabbit approved
   @GetMapping("/weather")
   public WeatherData getWeather(
     @Valid @Pattern(regexp = "^[0-9.-]+,[0-9.-]+$") String coordinates
   ) {
     // Validated coordinates only
   }
   ```

3. **Farmer Data Privacy:**
   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå CodeRabbit should flag this
   const farmerData = {
     name: "John Doe",
     location: "exact GPS coordinates", // Privacy violation
     income: 50000                      // Sensitive data
   };
   
   // ‚úÖ CodeRabbit approved
   const farmerData = {
     farmerId: hashId(farmer.id),       // Anonymized
     region: generalizeLocation(coords), // Generalized location
     incomeRange: getIncomeRange(income) // Categorized data
   };
   ```

#### **Step 5: Performance Optimization for Rural Networks**
**CodeRabbit must check for rural connectivity optimizations:**

1. **Image Compression:**
   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå CodeRabbit should flag
   const uploadImage = (file: File) => {
     // No compression - will fail on 2G networks
     return api.post('/upload', file);
   };
   
   // ‚úÖ CodeRabbit approved
   const uploadImage = async (file: File) => {
     const compressed = await compressForRural(file, {
       maxSize: 500 * 1024,    // 500KB max
       quality: 0.7,           // 70% quality
       maxDimensions: [800, 600] // Reasonable size
     });
     return api.post('/upload', compressed);
   };
   ```

2. **Offline Support:**
   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå CodeRabbit should flag missing offline support
   const getCropRecommendations = async (cropType: string) => {
     return api.get(`/recommendations/${cropType}`); // Fails offline
   };
   
   // ‚úÖ CodeRabbit approved
   const getCropRecommendations = async (cropType: string) => {
     try {
       return await api.get(`/recommendations/${cropType}`);
     } catch (error) {
       return getOfflineRecommendations(cropType); // Offline fallback
     }
   };
   ```

#### **Step 6: Accessibility Compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)**
**CodeRabbit must verify accessibility for rural farmers:**

1. **Screen Reader Support:**
   ```tsx
   {/* ‚ùå CodeRabbit should flag */}
   <button onClick={diagnoseCrop}>
     <img src="crop-icon.png" />
   </button>
   
   {/* ‚úÖ CodeRabbit approved */}
   <button 
     onClick={diagnoseCrop}
     aria-label="Diagnose crop health using image analysis"
     aria-describedby="crop-diagnosis-help"
   >
     <img src="crop-icon.png" alt="Crop diagnosis icon" />
   </button>
   <div id="crop-diagnosis-help" className="sr-only">
     Upload a photo of your crop to get instant health analysis and treatment recommendations
   </div>
   ```

2. **Multi-language Support:**
   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå CodeRabbit should flag hardcoded English
   const message = "Your crop is healthy";
   
   // ‚úÖ CodeRabbit approved
   const message = t('crop.health.healthy', {
     defaultValue: 'Your crop is healthy',
     context: 'agricultural'
   });
   ```

This document defines the coding standards and best practices for building Kheti Sahayak's agricultural technology platform.

## üèóÔ∏è **Kheti Sahayak Architecture Principles**

### **Agricultural Platform Vision**
- **Farmer-Centric Design:** Every feature must prioritize farmer usability and agricultural workflows
- **Multi-Crop Support:** Features should work across different crop types and farming practices
- **Scalable Agricultural Data:** Architecture must support millions of farmers and agricultural records
- **Offline-First:** Ensure functionality works in areas with poor internet connectivity
- **Multi-Language Support:** Hindi, English, and regional language support for Indian farmers

### **Agricultural Environment Standards**
- **Environment Separation:** Local (dev), Staging (UAT), Production (farmers)
- **Configuration Externalization:** All agricultural API keys, database configs externalized
- **Cloud Ready:** AWS/Azure support for scalable agricultural data processing
- **Security by Design:** Farmer data protection, no hardcoded secrets, GDPR compliance
- **Mobile-First:** Optimized for Android devices commonly used by farmers

### **Agricultural Data Principles**
- **Crop Data Integrity:** Ensure accuracy of agricultural recommendations and diagnostics
- **Weather Integration:** Real-time weather data integration for farming decisions
- **Market Data Accuracy:** Up-to-date market prices and commodity information
- **Geolocation Privacy:** Secure handling of farm location data
- **Seasonal Adaptability:** Features adapt to different farming seasons and cycles

## üìú **Code Readability and Style**

* **Clarity over cleverness:** Write code that is easy to understand, even if it's not the shortest possible solution.
* **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. A good name should explain its purpose without needing extra comments.
* **Consistency:** Adhere to a consistent coding style throughout the project (e.g., variable naming, indentation, brace placement). Use a linter to enforce style rules automatically.
* **Domain-Driven Naming:** Use terminology that reflects the platform's vocabulary.

***

## üß± **SOLID Principles for Software Platforms**

The SOLID principles are essential for building maintainable, scalable platforms that can serve multiple domains effectively.

### **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

* **A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.**
* **Application:** Each service should handle one specific capability (e.g., catalog management, order processing, payment handling)
* **Domain Agnostic Design:** Services should not be tied to specific domains but should be universally applicable
* **File Structure:** If a class's length is increasing, it's a strong indicator that it's taking on too many responsibilities. Refactor these responsibilities into new, focused classes, and place each new class in its own file.
* **Example:** `FeedService` should only handle feed generation logic, while `UniversalFeedService` should handle common feed logic.

### **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

* **Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.**
* **Platform Extensibility:** New domains should be added without modifying existing core platform code
* **Feature Extensions:** New features should be pluggable into the existing platform architecture
* **Implementation:** Use interfaces and abstract classes to define contracts that can be extended for new domains
* **Example:** `FeedPublisher` interface can be extended for new domains without modifying existing implementations.

### **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

* **Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.**
* **Domain Interchangeability:** Any domain-specific implementation should be replaceable with another without breaking the platform
* **Service Substitution:** Platform services should work consistently regardless of the specific domain implementation
* **Example:** Any `DomainFeedService` implementation should work seamlessly with the `UniversalFeedProcessor`.

### **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

* **Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.**
* **Domain-Specific Interfaces:** Create specific interfaces for each domain's unique requirements
* **Platform Interfaces:** Keep platform-level interfaces focused on common functionality
* **Example:** `CatalogService` should not depend on unrelated domain interfaces.

### **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

* **High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.**
* **Platform Independence:** High-level platform services should not depend on specific domain implementations
* **Cloud Service Abstraction:** Platform should depend on cloud service abstractions, not specific implementations
* **Configuration Abstraction:** Services should depend on configuration abstractions, not specific environment implementations
* **Example:** `FeedProcessor` should depend on `ConfigurationService` interface, not specific YAML or properties implementations.
 
***
 
## ‚úçÔ∏è **Documentation Standards for Software Platforms**

### **API Documentation**
* **OpenAPI/Swagger:** All REST APIs must be documented with OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
* **Domain-Specific APIs:** Document APIs that are specific to business domains separately
* **Platform APIs:** Document common platform APIs that work across all domains
* **Integration Documentation:** Document all external service integrations (e.g., Azure Service Bus, Kafka, Cosmos DB)

### **Code Documentation**
* **Why, not What:** Comments should explain *why* a piece of code exists, its design choices, or complex business logic. The code itself should explain *what* it does.
* **Business Context:** Document business rules and domain-specific logic clearly
* **Class and Method-Level Comments:** Every class and public method should have JavaDoc explaining its purpose, arguments, return values, and any exceptions it might raise.
* **Configuration Documentation:** Document all environment-specific configurations and their purposes
* **Integration Points:** Document all external service integration points and their contracts

### **Architecture Documentation**
* **Platform Architecture:** Document the overall platform architecture and how different domains integrate
* **Service Dependencies:** Document service dependencies and data flow
* **Environment Configuration:** Document environment setup and configuration management
* **Deployment Documentation:** Document deployment procedures for different environments

* **Performance Testing:** Load test the platform for multi-domain scenarios
 
## ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud and Environment Configuration Standards**

### **Environment Management**
* **Profile-Based Configuration:** Use Spring profiles (local, dev, sit, prod) for environment-specific configurations
* **Externalized Configuration:** All sensitive data must be externalized using environment variables
* **Cloud Integration:** Leverage cloud provider's secret management for production secret management

#### **Automatic CodeRabbit Integration Commands:**

AI agents must use these commands when making changes:

1. **For Security Issues:**
   ```typescript
   // Always validate inputs
   @ValidatedInput({
     cropType: { type: 'enum', values: VALID_CROPS },
     location: { type: 'coordinates', required: true },
     farmerData: { type: 'encrypted', privacy: 'high' }
   })
   ```

2. **For Performance Issues:**
   ```typescript
   // Always optimize for rural networks
   @RuralOptimized({
     compression: true,
     offline: true,
     maxSize: '500KB',
     fallback: 'local-cache'
   })
   ```

3. **For Accessibility Issues:**
   ```tsx
   // Always add comprehensive accessibility
   @AccessibilityCompliant({
     ariaLabels: true,
     screenReader: true,
     keyboard: true,
     wcag: 'AA'
   })
   ```

4. **For Agricultural Domain Issues:**
   ```typescript
   // Always validate agricultural logic
   @AgriculturalValidation({
     crops: INDIAN_CROPS,
     seasons: ['kharif', 'rabi', 'zaid'],
     regions: INDIAN_STATES,
     weatherThresholds: FARMING_WEATHER_LIMITS
   })
   ```

#### **CodeRabbit Failure Response Protocol:**

If CodeRabbit analysis fails or finds critical issues, AI agents must:

1. **Stop Development:** Do not proceed with implementation
2. **Report Issues:** List all critical and high-priority issues found
3. **Provide Solutions:** Offer specific code fixes for each issue
4. **Request Approval:** Ask user to approve fixes before continuing
5. **Verify Fixes:** Re-run CodeRabbit analysis after applying fixes

#### **Example CodeRabbit Integration in AI Response:**

```markdown
## Implementation with CodeRabbit Analysis

### Original Code Issue (Flagged by CodeRabbit):
```typescript
// ‚ùå CRITICAL: No input validation
@PostMapping("/crop-diagnosis")
public ResponseEntity uploadImage(@RequestParam MultipartFile image) {
    return diagnosticsService.analyze(image);
}
```

### Fixed Code (CodeRabbit Approved):
```java
// ‚úÖ SECURE: Full validation and agricultural context
@PostMapping("/crop-diagnosis")
public ResponseEntity<DiagnosisResult> uploadImage(
    @Valid @ImageFile(maxSize = "5MB", types = {"jpg", "png"}) MultipartFile image,
    @Valid @CropType String cropType,
    @Valid @Coordinates String location
) {
    return ResponseEntity.ok(diagnosticsService.analyze(image, cropType, location));
}
```

### CodeRabbit Verification:
- ‚úÖ Security: Input validation added
- ‚úÖ Performance: File size limits enforced
