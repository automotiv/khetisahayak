# Unified Commerce Platform - Development Standards

This document defines the coding standards and best practices for the Unified Commerce Platform, serving Tata Group's diverse business verticals including Tata Cliq, Tata 1mg, Tata Jewellery, BigBasket, Tata Croma, and Tata 11.

## üèóÔ∏è **Platform Architecture Principles**

### **Universal Commerce Vision**
- **Multi-Vertical Support:** Every feature must be designed to work across all business verticals (fashion, healthcare, jewelry, grocery, electronics, mobile)
- **Category Agnostic:** Catalog and commerce features should be universally applicable
- **Scalable Design:** Architecture must support rapid expansion to new verticals
- **Consistent Experience:** Maintain uniform user experience across all Tata Group platforms

### **Environment-First Development**
- **Environment Separation:** Clear separation between local, dev, sit, and prod environments
- **Configuration Externalization:** All environment-specific settings must be externalized
- **Azure Cloud Ready:** Native support for Azure cloud services and integrations
- **Security by Design:** No hardcoded credentials, proper secret management

## üìú **Code Readability and Style**

* **Clarity over cleverness:** Write code that is easy to understand, even if it's not the shortest possible solution.
* **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. A good name should explain its purpose without needing extra comments.
* **Consistency:** Adhere to a consistent coding style throughout the project (e.g., variable naming, indentation, brace placement). Use a linter (like **Checkstyle** for Java, **ESLint** for JavaScript) to enforce style rules automatically.
* **Domain-Driven Naming:** Use business domain terminology that reflects the unified commerce platform's vocabulary.

## üß± **SOLID Principles for Unified Commerce Platform**

The SOLID principles are essential for building a maintainable, scalable unified commerce platform that can serve multiple business verticals effectively.

### **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
 
* **A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.**
* **Commerce Platform Application:** Each service should handle one specific business capability (e.g., catalog management, order processing, payment handling)
* **Vertical Agnostic Design:** Services should not be tied to specific business verticals but should be universally applicable
* **File Structure:** If a class's length is increasing, it's a strong indicator that it's taking on too many responsibilities. Refactor these responsibilities into new, focused classes, and place each new class in its own file.
* **Example:** `TataCliqFeedService` should only handle TataCliq-specific feed generation, while `UniversalFeedService` should handle common feed logic.

### **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
 
* **Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.**
* **Platform Extensibility:** New business verticals should be added without modifying existing core platform code
* **Feature Extensions:** New commerce features should be pluggable into the existing platform architecture
* **Implementation:** Use interfaces and abstract classes to define contracts that can be extended for new verticals
* **Example:** `FeedPublisher` interface can be extended for new verticals without modifying existing implementations.

### **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
 
* **Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.**
* **Vertical Interchangeability:** Any vertical-specific implementation should be replaceable with another without breaking the platform
* **Service Substitution:** Platform services should work consistently regardless of the specific vertical implementation
* **Example:** Any `VerticalFeedService` implementation should work seamlessly with the `UniversalFeedProcessor`.

### **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
 
* **Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.**
* **Vertical-Specific Interfaces:** Create specific interfaces for each vertical's unique requirements
* **Platform Interfaces:** Keep platform-level interfaces focused on common functionality
* **Example:** `JewelryCatalogService` should not depend on `PharmacyCatalogService` interfaces.

### **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
 
* **High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.**
* **Platform Independence:** High-level platform services should not depend on specific vertical implementations
* **Cloud Service Abstraction:** Platform should depend on cloud service abstractions, not specific implementations
* **Configuration Abstraction:** Services should depend on configuration abstractions, not specific environment implementations
* **Example:** `FeedProcessor` should depend on `ConfigurationService` interface, not specific YAML or properties implementations.

## ‚úçÔ∏è **Documentation Standards for Unified Commerce Platform**

### **API Documentation**
* **OpenAPI/Swagger:** All REST APIs must be documented with OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
* **Vertical-Specific APIs:** Document APIs that are specific to business verticals separately
* **Platform APIs:** Document common platform APIs that work across all verticals
* **Integration Documentation:** Document all external service integrations (Azure Service Bus, Kafka, Cosmos DB)

### **Code Documentation**
* **Why, not What:** Comments should explain *why* a piece of code exists, its design choices, or complex business logic. The code itself should explain *what* it does.
* **Business Context:** Document business rules and vertical-specific logic clearly
* **Class and Method-Level Comments:** Every class and public method should have JavaDoc explaining its purpose, arguments, return values, and any exceptions it might raise.
* **Configuration Documentation:** Document all environment-specific configurations and their purposes
* **Integration Points:** Document all external service integration points and their contracts

### **Architecture Documentation**
* **Platform Architecture:** Document the overall platform architecture and how different verticals integrate
